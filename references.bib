   abstract = {Recently, synthetic cannabinoids have been sprayed onto plant material, which is subsequently packaged and sold as "Spice" or "K2" to mimic the effects of marijuana. A recent report identified several synthetic additives in samples of "Spice/K2", including JWH-081, a synthetic ligand for the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). The deleterious effects of JWH-081 on brain function are not known, particularly on CB1 signaling, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we evaluated the effects of JWH-081 on pCaMKIV, pCREB, and pERK1/2 signaling events followed by long-term potentiation (LTP), hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks using CB1 receptor wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice. Acute administration of JWH-081 impaired CaMKIV phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in CB1 receptor WT mice was observed only at higher dose of JWH-081 (1.25 mg/kg). JWH-081 at higher dose impaired CaMKIV and CREB phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in CB1 receptor WT mice but not in KO mice and failed to alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, SR treated or CB1 receptor KO mice have a lower pCaMKIV/CaMKIV ratio and higher pCREB/CREB ratio compared with vehicle or WT littermates. In hippocampal slices, JWH-081 impaired LTP in CB1 receptor WT but not in KO littermates. Furthermore, JWH-081 at higher dose impaired object recognition, spontaneous alternation and spatial memory on the Y-maze in CB1 receptor WT mice but not in KO mice. Collectively our findings suggest that deleterious effects of JWH-081 on hippocampal function involves CB1 receptor mediated impairments in CaMKIV and CREB phosphorylation, LTP, learning and memory in mice. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid receptors are the most abundant G protein-coupled receptors in the brain and they mediate retrograde short-term inhibition of neurotransmitter release, as well as long-term depression of synaptic transmission at many excitatory synapses. The induction of presynaptically silent synapses is a means of modulating synaptic strength, which is important for synaptic plasticity. Persistent activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) mutes GABAergic terminals, although it is unclear if CB1Rs can also induce silencing at glutamatergic synapses. Cerebellar granule cells were transfected with VGLUT1-pHluorin to visualise the exo-endocytotic cycle. We found that prolonged stimulation (10 min) of cannabinoid receptors with the agonist HU-210 induces the silencing of previously active synapses. However, the presynaptic silencing induced by HU-210 is transient as it reverses after 20 min. cAMP with forskolin prevented CB1R-induced synaptic silencing, via activation of the Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (Epac). Furthermore, Epac activation accelerated awakening of already silent boutons. Electron microscopy revealed that silencing was associated with synaptic vesicle (SV) redistribution within the nerve terminal, which diminished the number of vesicles close to the active zone of the plasma membrane. Finally, by combining functional and immunocytochemical approaches, we observed a strong correlation between the release capacity of the nerve terminals and RIM1α protein content, but not that of Munc13-1 protein. These results suggest that prolonged stimulation of cannabinoid receptors can transiently silence glutamatergic nerve terminals. © 2014 Ramírez-Franco et al.},

   abstract = {Impairment of motor skills is one of the most common acute adverse effects of cannabis. Related studies have focused mainly on psychomotor alterations, and little is known about the direct impact of cannabinoids (CBs) on motoneuron physiology. As key modulators of synaptic function, CBs regulate multiple neuronal functions and behaviors. Presynaptic CB1 mediates synaptic strength depression by inhibiting neurotransmitter release, via a poorly understood mechanism. The present study examined the effect of CB agonists on excitatory synaptic inputs incoming to hypoglossal motoneurons (HMNs) in vitro and in vivo. The endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and the synthetic CB agonist WIN 55,212-2 rapidly and reversibly induced short-term depression (STD) of glutamatergic synapses on motoneurons by a presynaptic mechanism. Presynaptic effects were fully reversed by the CB1-selective antagonist AM281. Electrophysiological and electron microscopy analysis showed that WIN 55,212-2 reduced the number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) docked to active zones in excitatory boutons. Given that AM281 fully abolished depolarization-induced depression of excitation, motoneurons can be feasible sources of CBs, which in turn act as retrograde messengers regulating synaptic function. Finally, microiontophoretic application of the CB agonist O-2545 reversibly depressed, presumably via CB1, glutamatergic inspiratory-related activity of HMNs in vivo. Therefore, evidence support that CBs, via presynaptic CB1, induce excitatory STD by reducing the readily releasable pool of SVs at excitatory synapses, then attenuating motoneuron activity. These outcomes contribute a possible mechanistic basis for cannabis-associated motor performance disturbances such as ataxia, dysarthria and dyscoordination.},

Axonal growth inhibition by myelin and chondroitan sulfate proteoglycans may in part be controlled by Rho-GTPase, which mediates growth cone collapse. Here, we tested in vitro whether pharmacological inhibition of a major downstream effector of Rho, Rho-kinase, promotes axonal outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia grown on aggrecan. Aggrecan substrates stimulated Rho activity and were inhibitory to axonal growth. Y-27632 treatment promoted the growth of axons by 5- to 10-fold and induced "steamlined" growth cones with longer filopodia and smaller lamellipodia. Interestingly, more actin bundles reminiscent of stress fibers in the central domain of the growth cone were observed when grown on aggrecan compared to laminin. In addition, Y-27632 significantly promoted axonal growth on both myelin and adult rat spinal cord cryosections. Our data suggest that suppression of Rho-kinase activity may enhance axonal regeneration in the central nervous system. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

The transcriptional programs governing this process are relatively well characterized. However, how environmental cues instruct neuronal migration remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor is strictly required for appropriate pyramidal neuron migration in the developing cortex. Acute silencing of the CB 1 receptor alters neuronal morphology and impairs radial migration. Consequently, CB 1 siRNA-electroporated mice display cortical malformations mimicking subcortical band heterotopias and increased seizure susceptibility in adulthood. Importantly, rescuing the CB 1 deficiency-induced radial migration arrest by knockdown of the GTPase protein RhoA restored the hyperexcitable neuronal network and seizure susceptibility. Our findings show that CB 1 receptor/RhoA signaling regulates pyramidal neuron migration, and that deficient CB 1 receptor signaling may contribute to cortical development malformations leading to refractory epilepsy independently of its canonical neuromodulatory role in the adult brain.},

These findings led to the identification of a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that provides a direct link between Gα12/13 and Rho stimulation. Recent observations suggest that many cellular responses elicited by Gαq and its coupled receptors also require the functional activity of Rho. However, available evidence suggests that Gαq may act on pathways downstream from Rho rather than by promoting Rho activation. These seemingly conflicting observations and the recent development of sensitive assays to assess the in vivo levels of active Rho prompted us to ask whether Gαq and its coupled receptors can stimulate endogenous Rho. Here we show that the expression of activated forms of Gαq and the stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors or chimeric Gαq molecules that respond to Gi-linked receptors can promote a robust activation of endogenous Rho in HEK-293T cells. Interestingly, this response was not prevented by molecules interfering with the ability of Gα13 to stimulate its linked RhoGEFs, together suggesting the existence of a novel molecular mechanism by which Gαq and the large family of Gq-coupled receptors can regulate the activity of Rho and its downstream signaling pathways.},

Here, we describe another form of ECB signaling that triggers a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) localized to the lateral perforant path (LPP) which conveys semantic information from cortex to hippocampus. Two cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) signaling cascades were identified in hippocampus. The first is pregnenolone sensitive, targets vesicular protein Munc18-1 and depresses transmitter release; this cascade is engaged by CB1Rs in Schaffer-Commissural afferents to CA1 but not in the LPP, and it does not contribute to LTP. The second cascade is pregnenolone insensitive and LPP specific; it entails co-operative CB1R/β1-integrin signaling to effect synaptic potentiation via stable enhancement of transmitter release. The latter cascade is engaged during LPP-dependent learning. These results link atypical ECB signaling to the encoding of a fundamental component of episodic memory and suggest a novel route whereby endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids affect cognition.},

   abstract = {Until recently, endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling was largely studied in the context of synaptic plasticity in the postnatal brain in the absence of detailed knowledge of the nature of the enzyme(s) responsible for the synthesis of the eCBs. However, the identification of two diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLα and DAGLβ) responsible for the synthesis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) has increased the understanding of where this eCB is synthesised in relationship to the expression of cannabinoid receptor (CB)1 and CB2. Furthermore, the generation of knockout animals for each enzyme has allowed for the direct testing of their importance for established and emerging eCB functions. Based on this, we now know that DAGLα is enriched in dendritic spines that appose CB1-positive synaptic terminals, and that 2-AG functions as a retrograde signal controlling synaptic strength throughout the nervous system. Consequently, we have built on the principle that expression of eCB components dictates function to identify additional physiological functions of this signalling cassette. A number of studies have now provided support for DAGL-dependent eCB signalling playing important roles in brain development and in cellular plasticity in the adult nervous system. In this article, we will review evidence based on the localisation of the enzymes, as well as from genetic and pharmacological studies, that show DAGL-dependent eCB signalling to play an important role in axonal growth and guidance during development, in retrograde synaptic signalling at mature synapses, and in the control of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. © 2011 The Authors.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the widely expressed endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression3 (eCB-LTD), are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that eCB-LTD depends on the contractile properties of the pre-synaptic actomyosin cytoskeleton. Preventing this contractility, both directly by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II NMII ATPase and indirectly by inhibiting the upstream Rho-associated kinase ROCK, abolished long-term, but not short-term forms of cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity in both inhibitory hippocampal and excitatory cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, using 3D superresolution microscopy, we find an actomyosin contractility-dependent redistribution of synaptic vesicle pools within the presynaptic compartment following cannabinoid receptor activation, leading to vesicle clustering and depletion from the pre-synaptic active zone. These results suggest that cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity is mediated by a nanoscale structural reorganization of the presynaptic compartment produced by actomyosin contraction. By introducing the contractile NMII as an important actin binding/structuring protein in the dynamic regulation of synaptic function, our results open new perspectives in the understanding of mechanisms of synaptic and cognitive function, marijuana intoxication and psychiatric pathogenesis.},

In the present study, mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells were used as an in vitro model to investigate cannabinoid-induced neurite remodeling effects and to identify the involvement of cannabinoid receptors in this neurite remodeling process. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy, the endogenously expressed CB1, but not CB2, cannabinoid receptors were detected in morphologically differentiated N1E-115 cells. Activation of these natively expressed CB1 cannabinoid receptors by cannabinoid agonist HU-210 led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Importantly, HU-210 treatment induced neurite retraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of N1E-115 cells with a CB1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) suppressed HU-210-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, indicating that the knocking down of functional CB1 cannabinoid receptor expression was achieved. Antisense ODN pretreatment also abolished HU-210-induced neurite retraction, demonstrating the involvement of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in mediating the neurite remodeling effects of HU-210. In addition, reversing HU-210-induced intracellular cAMP declination by 8-Br-cAMP partially prevented HU-210-induced neurite retraction, indicating the involvement of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in mediating the neurite remodeling function of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in N1E-115 cells. These data demonstrate that neurite remodeling is a newly discovered function of CB1 cannabinoid receptors.

The presence of eCBs, their CB1 receptor (CB1R), and metabolizing enzymes at embryonic and early postnatal periods have been linked to developmental processes such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and migration, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a functional eCB system in the developing visual system and the role of CB1R during axon growth and retinothalamic development. Pharmacological treatment of retinal explants and primary cortical neuron cultures with ACEA, a selective CB1R agonist, induced a collapse of the growth cone (GC). Furthermore the application of AM251, a CB1R inverse agonist, to the neuronal cultures increased the surface area of GC. In vivo, intraocular injection of ACEA diminished retinal projection growth, while AM251 promoted growth and caused aberrant projections. In addition, compared with their wild-type littermates, CB1R-deficient adult mice revealed a lower level of eye-specific segregation of retinal projections in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Finally, we found that pharmacological modulation of CB1R affected the trafficking of Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) receptor to the plasma membrane in a PKA-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of DCC abolished the CB1R-induced reorganization of the GC. Overall, these findings establish a mechanism by which the CB1R influences GC behavior and nervous system development in concerted action with DCC. Copyright © 2011 the authors.},

   abstract = {There is recent evidence supporting the notion that the cannabinoid signaling system plays a modulatory role in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, survival of neural progenitors, neuritic elongation and guidance, and synaptogenesis. This assumption is based on the fact that cannabinoid 1-type receptors (CB1 receptors) and their ligands emerge early in brain development and are abundantly expressed in certain brain regions that play key roles in these processes. We have recently presented in vivo evidence showing that this modulatory action might be exerted through regulating the synthesis of the cell adhesion molecule L1 that is also a key element for those processes. To further explore this issue, we conducted here immunohistochemical studies aimed at determining the cellular substrates of CB1 receptor-L1 interactions in the rat brain during late fetal development. In this period, we previously found that the activation of CB1 receptors increased L1 synthesis in several forebrain white matter regions but not in gray matter areas. Using double labeling studies, we observed here colocalization of both proteins in fiber tracts including the corpus callosum, the adjacent subcortical white matter, the internal capsule and the anterior commissure. Experiments conducted with cultures of fetal rat cortical nerve cells revealed that L1 is present mainly in neurons but not in glial cells. This fact, together with the results obtained in the double labeling studies, would indicate that L1 and CB1 receptors should possibly be present in axons elongating through these white matter tracts, or, alternatively, in migrating neurons. Further experiments confirmed the presence of CB1 receptors in elongating axons, since these receptors colocalized with growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a marker of growth cones, but not with synaptophysin, a marker of active synaptic terminals, in the same forebrain white matter regions. Lastly, using cultured fetal rat cortical neurons, we also observed that the activation of cannabinoid receptors increased the levels of the full-length L1 and altered those of some active proteolytic fragments of this protein whose generation has been associated with specific steps in the process of neuritic elongation in cultured neurons. In summary, we have demonstrated that the effects caused by cannabinoid agonists on L1 are facilitated by the colocalization of this cell adhesion molecule with CB1 receptors in several forebrain white matter regions during fetal brain development. We have provided strong evidence that this phenomenon occurs in axons elongating through these white matter tracts, and we have explored in vitro how cannabinoid receptors influence L1 levels. Considering the role played by L1 in different events related to neural development, our observations support the occurrence of a physiological mechanism by which the cannabinoid system might regulate the process of axonal growth and guidance through regulating the synthesis and function of L1. © 2008 IBRO.},

For example, DAG lipase activity is required for FGF-stimulated calcium influx into neuronal growth cones, and this response is both necessary and sufficient for an axonal growth response. The mechanism that couples the hydrolysis of DAG to the calcium response is not known. The initial hydrolysis of DAG at the sn-1 position (by DAG lipase) will generate 2-arachidonylglycerol, and this molecule is well established as an endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist in the brain. In the present paper, we show that in rat cerebellar granule neurons, CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists inhibit axonal growth responses stimulated by N-cadherin and FGF2. Furthermore, three CB1 receptor agonists mimic the N-cadherin/FGF2 response at a step downstream from FGF receptor activation, but upstream from calcium influx into cells. In contrast, we could find no evidence for the CB1 receptor coupling the TrkB neurotrophin receptor to an axonal growth response in the same neurons. The observation that the CB1 receptor can couple the activated FGF receptor to an axonal growth response raises novel therapeutic opportunities.},

Statistical analyses of this network predicted a role for the breast cancer 1 protein BRCA1 in neuronal differentiation and a new pathway from CB1R through phosphoinositol 3-kinase to the transcription factor paired box 6 (PAX6). Both predictions were experimentally confirmed. Results of transcription factor activation experiments that used pharmacological inhibitors of kinases revealed a network organization of partial OR gates regulating kinases stacked above AND gates that control transcription factors, which together allow for distributed decision-making in CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth.},

   abstract = {The study of the signaling pathways regulating neurite outgrowth in culture is important because of their potential role in neuronal differentiation in vivo. We have previously shown that the Gαo/i-coupled CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) activates Rap1 to induce neurite outgrowth. Gαo/i also activates the Src-Stat3 pathway. Here, we studied the relationship between the Gao/i-Rap1 and Src-Stat3 pathways and the role of these signaling pathways in CB1R-mediated neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells. The CB1 agonist HU-210 induced pertussis toxin-sensitive Src and Stat3 phosphorylation. Dominant negative (DN) mutants of Src and Stat3 blocked CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth. Constitutively active Rap 1B and Ral-activated Src and CB1R-induced Src phosphorylation was inhibited by Rap1-DN and Ral-DN, indicating that both Rap1 and Ral mediate downstream signaling from Gαo/i for Src activation. Rap1-activated Ral and Ral-DN blocked Rap-induced Src phosphorylation. Gαo-induced Stat3 activation was blocked by Ral-DN, whereas v-Src-induced Stat3 activation was not inhibited by Ral-DN, indicating that the CB1R, through Gαo, mediates the sequential activation of Rap1 to Ral to Src to Stat3 in Neuro-2A cells. Downstream of Src, the CB1R also activated Rac1 and JNK, which enhanced CBR1-mediated Stat3 activation. Rac-DN blocked CB1R-induced activation of JNK. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK blocked Src and CB1R activation of Stat3, indicating that Rac and JNK are also involved in CB1R-mediated neurite outgrowth. Overall, this study demonstrated that Gαo/i-coupled CB1R triggers neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A through the activation of a signaling network containing two pathways that bifurcate at Src and converge at Stat3. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

However, the role of cannabinoid receptors in macrophage phagocytosis is undefined. In this study, we found that two murine macrophage lines (J774A.1 and RAW264.7) and peripheral blood macrophages all expressed CB1 and CB2 by immunofluorescence-staining, real time RT-PCR and Western blot. Macrophage phagocytic activity was determined by quantifying fluorescent intensity of the engulfed BioParticles or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. mAEA (CB1 agonist) enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages, but JWH133 (CB2 agonist) had no influence. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of CB1 inhibited mAEA-enhanced phagocytosis, while CB2 had no such effects. Meanwhile, activation of CB1 increased GTP-bounding active form of small GTPase RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42. AM281 (CB1 antagonist) and pertussis toxin (PTX, G(α) i/o protein inhibitor) decreased GTP-bound RhoA protein level with mAEA. In addition, PTX, C3 Transferase (RhoA inhibitor) or Y27632 (Rho-associated kinase ROCK inhibitor) attenuated CB1-mediated phagocytosis. These results confirm that activation of CB1 regulates macrophage phagocytosis through G(α) i/o/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of CB1 induced significant up-regulation of CB1 expression by real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, but not CB2. It indicated the existence of a positive feedback between CB1 activation and CB1 expression. The up-regulation of CB1 was RhoA-independent but it may contribute to maintaining high phagocytic activity of macrophages for a longer time. In conclusion, CB1 mediates macrophage phagocytosis by G(α) i/o/RhoA/ROCK signal axis. These data further underline the role of CB1 in macrophage phagocytic process.},

Here, we have used high-resolution video-enhanced microscopy of cultured dorsal root ganglia neurons together with immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes PKC-phosphorylated GAP-43 to correlate the distribution of phosphorylated GAP-43 with growth cone behavior. In quiescent, nontranslocating growth cones, phosphorylated GAP-43 was confined to the proximal neurite and the central organelle-rich region, and was low in organelle-poor lamellae. However, levels in lamellae were elevated when they became motile. Conversely, levels of phosphorylated GAP-43 were low in either lamellae that were actively retracting or in the central organelle-rich region and proximal neurite of growth cones that had totally collapsed. The results suggest a mechanism whereby phosphorylation of GAP-43 by PKC, potentially in response to extracellular signals, could direct the functional behavior of the growth cone.},

Expression of cannabinoid receptors did not alter proliferation rate, viability, or apoptosis relative to parental SH-SY5Y. Transcripts for endogenous cannabinoid system enzymes (diacylglycerol lipase, monoacylglycerol lipase, α/β-hydrolase domain containing proteins 6 and 12, N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D, and fatty acid amide hydrolase) were not altered by CB1 or CB2 expression. Endocannabinoid ligands 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide were quantitated in SH-SY5Y cells, and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin decreased 2-AG abundance by 90% but did not alter anandamide abundance. M3 muscarinic agonist oxotremorine M, and inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase and α/β hydrolase domain containing proteins 6 &12 increased 2-AG abundance. CB1 receptor expression increased lengths of short (<30 μm) and long (>30 μm) projections, and this effect was significantly reduced by tetrahydrolipstatin, indicative of stimulation by endogenously produced 2-AG. Pertussis toxin, Gβγ inhibitor gallein, and β-arrestin inhibitor barbadin did not significantly alter long projection length in CB1XS, but significantly reduced short projections, with gallein having the greatest inhibition. The rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 increased CB1 receptor-mediated long projection extension, indicative of actin cytoskeleton involvement. CB1 receptor expression increased GAP43 and ST8SIA2 mRNA and decreased ITGA1 mRNA, whereas CB2 receptor expression increased NCAM and SYT mRNA. We propose that basal endogenous production of 2-AG provides autocrine stimulation of CB1 receptor signaling through Gi/o, Gβγ, and β-arrestin mechanisms to promote neuritogenesis, and rho kinase influences process extension.},

Because these processes develop days or months after injury, they are accompanied by a therapeutic window of opportunity. The complexity and clinical significance of remote damage is prompting many groups to examine the factors of remote degeneration. This research is providing insights into key unanswered questions, opening new avenues for innovative neuroprotective therapies. In this review, we evaluate data from various remote degeneration models to describe the complexity of the systems that are involved and the importance of their interactions in reducing damage and promoting recovery after brain lesions. Specifically, we recapitulate the current data on remote neuronal degeneration, focusing on molecular and cellular events, as studied in stroke and brain and spinal cord injury models. Remote damage is a multifactorial phenomenon in which many components become active in specific time frames. Days, weeks, or months after injury onset, the interplay between key effectors differentially affects neuronal survival and functional outcomes. In particular, we discuss apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative damage, and autophagy—all of which mediate remote degeneration at specific times. We also review current findings on the pharmacological manipulation of remote degeneration mechanisms in reducing damage and sustaining outcomes. These novel treatments differ from those that have been proposed to limit primary lesion site damage, representing new perspectives on neuroprotection.},

Little or no cannabinoid receptor 2 immunoreactivity was found in sections of naive rat or mouse dorsal root ganglia or spinal cord. This was in accord with the lack of detectable cannabinoid receptor 2 mRNA in (dorsal root ganglion) neurons by in situ hybridization experiments described in the literature. However, we could detect cannabinoid receptor 2 immunoreactivity following unilateral nerve damage - either by sciatic nerve section, or by spinal nerve ligation. It was localized to the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, ipsilateral to the nerve damage, coincident with the area of termination of damaged afferents which was marked by loss of isolectin B4 binding. This upregulation was not seen in cannabinoid receptor 2 null mice. The cannabinoid receptor 2 protein in spinal cord appeared to be expressed on sensory neuron afferent terminals as it colocalized with two markers of damaged afferents, namely growth associated protein-43 and the neuropeptide galanin. Moreover, it did not colocalize with markers of activated microglial cells (OX-42) or astroglial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein) in rat spinal cord. In the peripheral nerve, accumulation of cannabinoid receptor 2 immunoreactivity was seen in nerve sections proximal, but not distal, to the ligation site, suggesting transport down the nerve from the cell bodies. Although convincing cannabinoid receptor 2 immunoreactivity was seen in neither uninjured nor injured dorsal root ganglion neuron cell bodies in tissue sections, expression was detectable in isolated, cultured neurons that had received a prior axotomy in vivo.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, axon regeneration is positively regulated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, which is activated by growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. Here we show that fatty acid amide hydrolase-1, an enzyme involved in the degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide), regulates the axon regeneration response of γ-aminobutyric acid neurons after laser axotomy. Exogenous arachidonoyl ethanolamide inhibits axon regeneration via the Goα subunit GOA-1, which antagonizes the Gqα subunit EGL-30. We further demonstrate that protein kinase C functions downstream of Gqα and activates the MLK-1-MEK-1-KGB-1 c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway by phosphorylating MLK-1. Our results show that arachidonoyl ethanolamide induction of a G protein signal transduction pathway has a role in the inhibition of post-development axon regeneration. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The effects are reported of several potent cannabinoid analogs (CP 55,244, CP 55,940, levonantradol and WIN 55,212-2) on cultured neurons from hippocampus, a brain region that exhibits high cannabinoid receptor density. The electrophysiological effects of cannabinoids were determined by whole-cell patch clamp recordings of voltage-dependent potassium currents. The voltage dependence of the rapidly inactivating potassium A current (IA), characteristic of hippocampal neurons, was significantly altered in a concentration-dependent manner by cannabinoid analogs. Decreased inactivation, which led to an increased activation of IA near resting levels in these cells, was observed after brief local extracellular applications of cannabinoids. These actions were blocked by pertussis toxin. Cellular dialysis of GTP-gamma-S mimicked the actions of cannabinoids on IA while blocking further effects due to added cannabinoids. The rank order of potency of the cannabinoid analogs was similar to that observed with respect to binding at cannabinoid receptors in brain membranes. The concentration-related effectiveness of cannabinoid analogs in modulating IA was similar to their potency in stimulating low Km GTPase in cell membranes isolated from the cannabinoid receptor-rich dentate gyrus. These data support the conclusion that cannabinoid effects on IA are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors. This cannabinoid-induced shift in the voltage dependence of IA could serve to counteract fast, transient, depolarizing events such as action potentials and synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons.},

Because cannabinoid receptors inhibit adenylate cyclase, the present study explored whether cAMP played a role in mediating this effect on I(A). The specific issue of whether cannabinoid receptor modulation of voltage- dependent I(A) acts via a cAMP-dependent process was investigated. The cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP, as well as the adenylate cyclase stimulant forskolin, produced concentration-dependent shifts in I(A) that were opposite those produced by cannabinoid receptor ligands. Moreover, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also produced a marked negative shift in the steady-state voltage dependence of I(A) and increased the effect of forskolin on I(A). As shown in previous studies, the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 increased I(A) via a decrease in steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation of I(A). WIN 55,212-2 also reversed the effects of forskolin on I(A). The electrophysiological studies were paralleled by direct assays of cAMP in these cells, where cannabinoids inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP by 50% in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. The results confirmed that pertussis toxin-sensitive cannabinoid receptor-mediated changes in I(A) were probably the result of inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The findings are discussed in terms of modulation of I(A) conductance properties via cannabinoid receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels within the cell.},

They are recognized as retrograde messengers that mediate long-term synaptic depression (LTD), but their ability to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) is poorly known. We show that eCBs induce the long-term enhancement of transmitter release at single hippocampal synapses through stimulation of astrocytes when coincident with postsynaptic activity. This LTP requires the coordinated activity of the 3 elements of the tripartite synapse: 1) eCB-evoked astrocyte calcium signal that stimulates glutamate release; 2) postsynaptic nitric oxide production; and 3) activation of protein kinase C and presynaptic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, whose location at presynaptic sites was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Hence, while eCBs act as retrograde signals to depress homoneuronal synapses, they serve as lateral messengers to induce LTP in distant heteroneuronal synapses through stimulation of astrocytes. Therefore, eCBs can trigger LTP through stimulation of astrocyte-neuron signaling, revealing novel cellular mechanisms of eCB effects on synaptic plasticity.},

This synaptic potentiation is due to CB1R-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in astrocytes, which stimulate the release of glutamate that activates presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. While endocannabinoids induce synaptic depression in the stimulated neuron by direct activation of presynaptic CB1Rs, they indirectly lead to synaptic potentiation in relatively more distant neurons by activation of CB1Rs in astrocytes. Hence, astrocyte calcium signal evoked by endogenous stimuli (neuron-released endocannabinoids) modulates synaptic transmission.

CB1 agonists produce depression that mimics and occludes tLTD. This agonist-induced LTD requires presynaptic activity and NMDAR activation, but not postsynaptic Ca2+ influx. Further experiments demonstrate the existence of presynaptic NMDARs that underlie the presynaptic activity dependence. Finally, manipulating cannabinoid breakdown alters the temporal window for tLTD. In conclusion, tLTD requires simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA and CB1 receptors. This novel form of coincidence detection may explain the temporal window of tLTD and may also impart synapse specificity to cannabinoid retrograde signaling.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid agonists might serve as neuroprotective agents in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we examined this hypothesis in a rat model of Huntington's disease (HD) generated by intrastriatal injection of the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor malonate. Our results showed that only compounds able to activate CB2 receptors were capable of protecting striatal projection neurons from malonate-induced death. That CB2 receptor agonists are neuroprotective was confirmed by using the selective CB2 receptor antagonist, SR144528, and by the observation that mice deficient in CB2 receptor were more sensitive to malonate than wild-type animals. CB2 receptors are scarce in the striatum in healthy conditions, but they are markedly upregulated after the lesion with malonate. Studies of double immunostaining revealed a significant presence of CB2 receptors in cells labeled with the marker of reactive microglia OX-42, and also in cells labeled with GFAP (a marker of astrocytes). We further showed that the activation of CB2 receptors significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) that had been increased by the lesion with malonate. In summary, our results demonstrate that stimulation of CB2 receptors protect the striatum against malonate toxicity, likely through a mechanism involving glial cells, in particular reactive microglial cells in which CB2 receptors would be upregulated in response to the lesion. Activation of these receptors would reduce the generation of proinflammatory molecules like TNF-α. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that CB2 receptors could constitute a therapeutic target to slowdown neurodegeneration in HD. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids exert pleiotropic actions in the CNS, including the inhibition of inflammatory responses and the enhancement of neuronal survival after injury. Although cannabinoid receptors are distributed widely in brain, their presence has not been investigated previously in oligodendrocytes. This study examined the expression of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors in rat oligodendrocytes in vivo and in culture and explored their biological function. Expression of CB1 receptors by oligodendrocytes was demonstrated immunocytochemically in postnatal and in adult white matter as well as in oligodendrocyte cultures. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting further confirmed the presence of CB1 receptors. Oligodendrocyte progenitors undergo apoptosis with the withdrawal of trophic support, as determined by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation, and both the selective CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide/(all Z)-N-(2-cycloethyl)-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenamide (ACEA) and the nonselective cannabinoid agonists HU210 and (+)-Win-55212-2 enhanced cell survival. To investigate intracellular signaling involved in cannabinoid protection, we focused on the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. HU210, (+)-Win-55212-2, and ACEA elicited a time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. Pertussis toxin abolished Akt activation, indicating the involvement of Gi/Go-protein-coupled receptors. The CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A partially inhibited Akt phosphorylation in response to HU210 and (+)-Win-55212-2 and abolished the effects of ACEA. Trophic support deprivation downregulated Akt activity, and cannabinoids recovered phospho-Akt levels. Inhibition of PI3K abrogated the survival action and the recovery of Akt activity in response to cannabinoids. SR141716A prevented only the protection conferred by ACEA. Nevertheless, SR141716A and the selective CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 in combination inhibited the prosurvival action of HU210, which is in accordance with the finding of CB2 receptor expression by oligodendroglial cells. These data identify oligodendrocytes as potential targets of cannabinoid action in the CNS.},

   abstract = {G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is a putative cannabinoid receptor that is expressed in several tissues involved in regulating energy homeostasis, including the hypothalamus, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, white adipose and skeletal muscle. GPR55 has been shown to have a role in cancer and gastrointestinal inflammation, as well as in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite this, the (patho)physiological role of GPR55 in cell dysfunction is still poorly understood, largely because of the limited identification of downstream signalling targets. Nonetheless, research has suggested that GPR55 modulation would be a useful pharmacological target in metabolically active tissues to improve treatment of diseases such as obesity and T2DM. Further research is essential to gain a better understanding of the role that this receptor might have in these and other pathophysiological conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {To present a summary of current scientific evidence about the cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD) with regard to its relevance to epilepsy and other selected neuropsychiatric disorders. We summarize the presentations from a conference in which invited participants reviewed relevant aspects of the physiology, mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and data from studies with animal models and human subjects. Cannabis has been used to treat disease since ancient times. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is the major psychoactive ingredient and CBD is the major nonpsychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Cannabis and Δ9-THC are anticonvulsant in most animal models but can be proconvulsant in some healthy animals. The psychotropic effects of Δ9-THC limit tolerability. CBD is anticonvulsant in many acute animal models, but there are limited data in chronic models. The antiepileptic mechanisms of CBD are not known, but may include effects on the equilibrative nucleoside transporter; the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55; the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type-1 channel; the 5-HT1a receptor; and the α3 and α1 glycine receptors. CBD has neuroprotective and antiinflammatory effects, and it appears to be well tolerated in humans, but small and methodologically limited studies of CBD in human epilepsy have been inconclusive. More recent anecdotal reports of high-ratio CBD:Δ9-THC medical marijuana have claimed efficacy, but studies were not controlled. CBD bears investigation in epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, we lack data from well-powered double-blind randomized, controlled studies on the efficacy of pure CBD for any disorder. Initial dose-tolerability and double-blind randomized, controlled studies focusing on target intractable epilepsy populations such as patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes are being planned. Trials in other treatment-resistant epilepsies may also be warranted.

   abstract = {Pharmacological studies suggest a role for CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) in regulating neurogenesis in the adult brain. To investigate this possibility, we measured neurogenesis by intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which labels newborn neurons, in wild-type and CB1R-knockout (CB1R-KO) mice. CB1R-KO mice showed reductions in the number of BrdU-labeled cells to ∼50% of wild-type (WT) levels in dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), suggesting that CB1R activation promotes neurogenesis. To test this further, WT mice were given the CB1R antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4- chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride (SR141716A) before measuring neurogenesis with BrdU. SR141716A paradoxically increased the number of BrdU-labeled cells by ∼50% in SVZ; another CB1R antagonist, 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1- piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251), had a similar effect. To investigate this discrepancy, SR141716A was given to CB1R-KO mice, in which it still stimulated neurogenesis, indicating involvement of a non-CB1 receptor. Action at one such non-CB1, SR141716A-sensitive site, the VR1 vanilloid receptor, was tested by administering SR141716A to VR1-KO mice, in which the ability of SR141716A to enhance neurogenesis was abolished. Thus, CB1 and VR1 receptors both seem to have roles in regulating adult neurogenesis.},

It has been suggested that different intracellular responses may be activated depending on the ligand. The goal of the present study was to characterize the pattern of G protein subunit stimulation triggered by three different cannabinoid ligands, Δ9-THC, WIN55212-2, and ACEA in mouse brain cortex. Stimulation of the [35S]GTPγS binding coupled to specific immunoprecipitation with antibodies against different subtypes of G proteins (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, Gαz, Gαs, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13), in the presence of Δ9-THC, WIN55212-2 and ACEA (submaximal concentration 10 μM) was determined by scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technique in mouse cortex of wild type, CB1 knock-out, CB2 knock-out and CB1/CB2 double knock-out mice. Results show that, in mouse brain cortex, cannabinoid agonists are able to significantly stimulate not only the classical inhibitory Gαi/o subunits but also other G subunits like Gαz, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13. Moreover, the specific pattern of G protein subunit activation is different depending on the ligand. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, in mice brain native tissue, different exogenous cannabinoid ligands are able to selectively activate different inhibitory and non-inhibitory Gα protein subtypes, through the activation of CB1 and/or CB2 receptors. Results of the present study may help to understand the specific molecular pathways involved in the pharmacological effects of cannabinoid-derived drugs.},

   abstract = {1. Excitatory synaptic transmission between pairs of monosynaptically coupled pyramidal cells was examined in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Action potentials were elicited in single CA3 pyramidal cells impaled with microelectrodes and unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamped CA1 or CA3 cells. 2. The amplitude of successive unitary EPSCs in response to single action potentials varied. The amplitude of EPSCs was altered by adenosine or changes in the [Mg2+]/[Ca2+] ratio. We conclude that single action potentials triggered the release of multiple quanta of glutamate. 3. When two action potentials were elicited in the presynaptic cell, the amplitude of the second EPSC was inversely related to the amplitude of the first. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was observed when the first EPSC was small, i.e. the second EPSC was larger than the first, whereas paired-pulse depression (PPD) was observed when the first EPSC) was large. 4. The number of trials displaying PPD was greater when release probability was increased, and smaller when release probability was decreased. 5. PPD was not postsynaptically mediated because it was unaffected by decreasing ionic flux with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or receptor desensitization with aniracetam. 6. PPF was maximal at an interstimulus interval of 70 ms and recovered within 500 ms. Recovery from PPD occurred within 5 s. 7. We propose that multiple release sites are formed by the axon of a CA3 pyramidal cell and a single postsynaptic CA1 or CA3 cell. PPF is observed if the first action potential fails to release transmitter at most release sites. PPD is observed if the first action potential successfully triggers release at most release sites. 8. Our observations of PPF are consistent with the residual calcium hypothesis. We conclude that PPD results from a decrease in quantal content, perhaps due to short-term depletion of readily releasable vesicles.},

Kinetic analyses showed that [35S]GTPγS binding reached stead-state levels and that the association rates was increased by the agonist WIN 55212-2 proportional to the concentration of GDP. Dissociation of [35S]GTPγS occurred with two rates (t( 1/4 ) = 7 and 170 min), and WIN 55212-2 increased the proportion of sites exhibiting the faster rate. Without GDP, [35S]GTPγS bound to membranes with high and low affinity, and WIN 55212-2 had no effect. With 30 μM GDP, [35S]GTPγS bound to low and intermediate affinity sites, and WIN 55212-2 induced high affinity [35S]GTPγS binding without affecting low affinity sites. GDP competed for high affinity [35S]GTPγS binding with high and intermediate affinity in the absence of WIN 55212-2 and with high and low affinity in the presence of WIN 55212-2. Cannabinoid ligands displayed differential abilities to maximally stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in the presence of GDP. Efficacy differences among ligands increased with increasing GDP concentrations. GDP competition curves revealed that agonists induced low affinity GDP K(i) values that were proportional to agonist E(ma) values, indicating that agonist efficacy is predetermined by displacement of GDP from G-proteins.},

In contrast, activation of K(ir) current by somatostatin was unaffected, and inhibition of calcium channels was only modestly attenuated. The possibility that PKC acted by phosphorylating CB1 receptors was confirmed by demonstrating that PKC phosphorylated a single serine (S317) of a fusion protein incorporating the third intracellular loop of CB1. Mutating this serine to alanine did not affect the ability of CB1 to modulate currents, but it eliminated disruption by PMA, demonstrating that PKC can disrupt ion channel modulation by receptor phosphorylation.},

   abstract = {Neurotransmission in the nervous system is initiated at presynaptic terminals by fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and subsequent exocytic release of chemical transmitters. Currently, there are multiple methods to detect neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals, each with their own particular advantages and disadvantages. For instance, most commonly employed methods monitor actions of released chemical substances on postsynaptic receptors or artificial substrates such as carbon fibers. These methods are closest to the physiological setting because they have a rapid time resolution and they measure the action of the endogenous neurotransmitters rather than the signals emitted by exogenous probes. However, postsynaptic receptors only indirectly report neurotransmitter release in a form modified by the properties of receptors themselves, which are often nonlinear detectors of released substances. Alternatively, released chemical substances can be detected biochemically, albeit on a time scale slower than electrophysiological methods. In addition, in certain preparations, where presynaptic terminals are accessible to whole cell recording electrodes, fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane can be monitored using capacitance measurements. In the last decade, in addition to electrophysiological and biochemical methods, several fluorescence imaging modalities have been introduced which report synaptic vesicle fusion, endocytosis, and recycling. These methods either take advantage of styryl dyes that can be loaded into recycling vesicles or exogenous expression of synaptic vesicle proteins tagged with a pH-sensitive GFP variant at regions facing the vesicle lumen. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of these methods with particular emphasis on their relative strengths and weaknesses and discuss the types of information one can obtain from them.},

   abstract = {Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells release catecholamines and neuropeptides in an activity-dependent manner controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Under basal sympathetic tone, catecholamines are preferentially secreted. During acute stress, increased sympathetic firing evokes release of both catecholamines as well as neuropeptides. Both signalling molecules are co-packaged in the same large dense core granules, thus release of neuropeptide transmitters must be regulated after granule fusion with the cell surface. Previous work has indicated this may be achieved through a size-exclusion mechanism whereby, under basal sympathetic firing, the catecholamines are selectively released through a restricted fusion pore, while less-soluble neuropeptides are left behind in the dense core. Only under the elevated firing experienced during the sympathetic stress response do the granules fully collapse to expel catecholamines and neuropeptides. However, mechanistic description and physiological regulation of this process remain to be determined. We employ electrochemical amperometry, fluid-phase dye uptake and electrophysiological capacitance noise analysis to probe the fusion intermediate in mouse chromaffin cells under physiological electrical stimulation. We show that basal firing rates result in the selective release of catecholamines through an Ω-form ‘kiss and run’ fusion event characterized by a narrow fusion pore. Increased firing raises calcium levels and activates protein kinase C, which then promotes fusion pore dilation until full granule collapse occurs. Our results demonstrate that the transition between ‘kiss and run’ and ‘full collapse’ exocytosis serves a vital physiological regulation in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells and help effect a proper acute stress response.},

Using superfused synaptosomes, we have studied the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, measured as the amount of release triggered by hypertonic sucrose. We show that activation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors by dihydroxyphenylglycine and stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters enhance the readily releasable pool of glutamate. Although the molecular nature of the readily releasable pool is unknown, one possibility is that during its generation, SNARE proteins form full core complexes, and that core complex formation occurs prior to neurotransmitter release. To test this possibility, we employed N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an inhibitor of the ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor that dissociates core complexes, to study the relation of the readily releasable pool to core complex assembly in synaptosomes. NEM induced a dose-dependent increase in the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters but by itself did not trigger release. Direct measurements of core complexes confirmed that NEM caused an increase in the levels of SNARE core complexes under these conditions. Our data suggest that in the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, SNARE proteins are fully assembled into core complexes, and that SNARE complex assembly is a target of presynaptic regulation.},

   abstract = {At the synapse, neurotransmitter release is triggered physiologically by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Non-physiologically, release can be evoked by a potent neurotoxin, α-latrotoxin, and by hypertonic sucrose. Controversy has arisen on whether release evoked by α-latrotoxin and hypertonic sucrose requires extracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Using synaptosomes, we have studied the Ca2+ dependence of α-latrotoxin and sucrose action in different neurotransmitter systems. In agreement with previous data, no requirement for extracellular Ca2+ in sucrose-induced secretion of norepinephrine, dopamine, glutamate or GABA was detected. Unexpectedly, we observed large differences between these neurotransmitters in the Ca2+ dependence of α-latrotoxin-stimulated release: norepinephrine release required Ca2+, dopamine release was only partially Ca2+ dependent, and glutamate and GABA release did not require Ca2+. To test if Ca2+ derived from intracellular Ca2+ stores participates in neurotransmitter release triggered by α-latrotoxin or hypertonic sucrose, we employed thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor that empties Ca2+ stores. Thapsigargin did not induce neurotransmitter release, nor did it inhibit subsequent release stimulated by KCl depolarization, hypertonic sucrose or α-latrotoxin. However, intracellular Ca2+ performs an important regulatory function, since thapsigargin increased the size of the readily releasable pool as measured by stimulation with hypertonic sucrose. This effect required extracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C, suggesting that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores leads to store-operated Ca2+ entry. The resulting Ca2+ influx does not trigger release by itself, but activates protein kinase C that increases the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters.Our data show that internal and external Ca2+ is not acutely involved in hypertonic sucrose-evoked neurotransmitter release, while α-latrotoxin-triggered release requires external Ca2+ for a subset of neurotransmitters. Although internal Ca2+ is not essential for release, it modulates its extent, implying that the emptying of intracellular stores by activation of presynaptic receptors plays an important regulatory role in neurotransmitter release.

   abstract = {Secretion from neurons and neuroendocrine cells is enhanced by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in various preparations. We have already reported that transmitter (glutamate) release from Mb1 bipolar cells in the goldfish retina is potentiated by the activation of PKC. However, it is not yet settled whether the potentiation is ascribed to the increase in the pool size of releasable synaptic vesicles or in release probability. In the present study, Ca2+ influx and exocytosis were simultaneously monitored by measuring the presynaptic Ca2+ current and membrane capacitance changes, respectively, in a terminal detached from the bipolar cell. The double pulse protocol was used to estimate separately the changes in the pool size and release probability. The activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) specifically increased the pool size but not the release probability. PKC was activated by PMA even after the Ca2+ influx was blocked by Co2+. In bipolar cells the releasable pool can be divided into two components: one is small and rapidly exhausted, and the other is large and slowly exocytosed. To identify which component is responsible for the increase in the pool size, the effects of PMA and a PKC-specific inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS), on each component were examined. The slow component was selectively increased by PMA and reduced by BIS. Thus, we conclude that the activation of PKC in Mb1 bipolar cells potentiates glutamate release by increasing the pool size of the slow component.},

An artificial signal sequence (SS) was required for efficient surface expression of CB1 receptor chimeras, which behaved like wild-type CB1 receptors in functional assays. Treatment with cannabinoid ligands led to a rapid down-regulation of SS-GFP-CB1 from the plasma membrane in COS7 and HEK293 cells, associated with trafficking into cytosolic vesicles. Activation of CB1 receptors was also linked with a time-dependent reduction in cell surface SEP-CB1 fluorescence and incorporation of the construct into acidic endosomes, revealed following exposure to NH4Cl. In live hippocampal neurons, SEP-CB1 fluorescence was largely restricted to the axon, consistent with its polarised surface expression. Thus, these new molecular tools are well suited for studying CB1 receptor trafficking and a new generation of GPCR chimeras incorporating SEP at the N-terminus will be especially useful for monitoring dynamic changes in cell surface receptor expression in living cells. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Stable clones of HEK293 cells expressing either FLAG(TM) epitope-tagged, wild type human β1- and β2-adrenoceptors or C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged forms of these receptors were established. 2. The binding affinity of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and other ligands was little affected by addition of GFP to the C-terminal of either receptor. 3. Isoprenaline induced the internalisation of both β1-adrenoceptor-GFP and β2-adrenoceptor-GFP and following removal of the agonist both constructs were able to recycle to the cell surface. 4. The extent of internalisation of β2-adrenoceptor-GFP produced by isoprenaline was substantially greater than for β1-adrenoceptor-GFP. 5. C-terminal addition of GFP slowed markedly the rate of internalization of both the β1-adrenoceptor and the β2- adrenoceptor in response to isoprenaline. 6. Sustained exposure to isoprenaline (24 h) produced substantially greater levels of downregulation of native β2-adrenoceptor compared to β2-adrenoceptor-GFP although both were equally effectively removed from the plasma membrane. 7. Sustained exposure to isoprenaline resulted in a large fraction of β2-adrenoceptor-GFP becoming trapped in internal vesicles/lysosomes but not degraded. 8. Even after sustained exposure to isoprenaline a significant fraction of β1-adrenoceptor-GFP remained at the cell surface. 9. These results indicate that although GFP tagging of β-adrenoceptors can provide qualitative visual patterns of agonist-induced receptor trafficking and regulation in HEK293 cells the quantitative details vary markedly from those obtained with the unmodified receptors.},

   abstract = {Presynaptic activation of the diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is a central event in short-term synaptic plasticity. Two substrates, Munc13-1 and Munc18-1, are essential for DAGinduced potentiation of vesicle priming, but the role of most presynaptic PKC substrates is not understood. Here, we show that a mutation in synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1T112A), which prevents its PKCdependent phosphorylation, abolishes DAG-induced potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. This mutant also reduces potentiation of spontaneous release, but only if alternative Ca2+ sensors, Doc2A/B proteins, are absent. However, unlike mutations in Munc13-1 or Munc18-1 that prevent DAG-induced potentiation, the synaptotagmin-1 mutation does not affect pairedpulse facilitation. Furthermore, experiments to probe vesicle priming (recovery after train stimulation and dual application of hypertonic solutions) also reveal no abnormalities. Expression of synaptotagmin-2, which lacks a seven amino acid sequence that contains the phosphorylation site in synaptotagmin-1, or a synaptotagmin-1 variant with these seven residues removed (Syt1-109-116), supports normal DAG-induced potentiation. These data suggest that this seven residue sequence in synaptotagmin-1 situated in the linker between the transmembrane and C2A domains is inhibitory in the unphosphorylated state and becomes permissive of potentiation upon phosphorylation. We conclude that synaptotagmin-1 phosphorylation is an essential step in PKC-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission, acting downstream of the two other essential DAG/PKC substrates, Munc13-1 and Munc18-1.},

However, insights into the molecular mechanisms modulating synaptic transmission and the repercussions for neuronal activity within the LHb remain elusive. Here, we report that, in mice, activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors triggers long-term depression at excitatory (eLTD) and inhibitory (iLTD) synapses in the LHb. mGluR-eLTD and iLTD rely on mGluR1 and PKC signaling. However, mGluR-dependent adaptations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission differ in their expression mechanisms. mGluR-eLTD occurs via an endocannabinoid receptor-dependent decrease in glutamate release. Conversely, mGluR-iLTD occurs postsynaptically through PKC-dependent reduction of β2-containing GABAA-R function. Finally, mGluR-dependent plasticity of excitation or inhibition decides the direction of neuronal firing, providing a synaptic mechanism to bidirectionally control LHb output. We propose mGluR-LTD as a cellular substrate that underlies LHb-dependent encoding of opposing motivational states.},

Accumulating evidence has shown the involvement of ROCK activation in the pathogenesis of many diseases. However, a reagent capable of detecting ROCK activation directly is lacking. In the present study, we show autophosphorylation of ROCKII in an in vitro kinase reaction. The phosphorylation sites were identified by MS, and the major phosphorylation site was found to be at the highly conserved residue Ser 1366. A phospho-specific antibody was generated that can specifically recognize ROCKII Ser 1366 phosphorylation. We found that the extent of Ser 1366phosphorylation of endogenous ROCKII is correlated with that of myosin light chain phosphorylation in cells in response to RhoA stimulation, showing that Ser 1366 phosphorylation reflects its kinase activity. In addition, ROCKII Ser 1366 phosphorylation could be detected in human breast tumours by immunohistochemical staining.

   abstract = {The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated in an autocrine fashion by the endocannabinoids (EC), N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The CB1 and its endogenous and synthetic agonists are emerging as therapeutic targets in several cancers due to their ability to suppress carcinoma cell invasion and migration. However, the mechanisms that the CB1 regulates cell motility are not well understood. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms that diminish cell migration upon the CB1 activation in prostate carcinoma cells. The CB1 activation with the agonist WIN55212 significantly diminishes the small GTPase RhoA activity but modestly increases the Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. The diminished RhoA activity is accompanied by the loss of actin/myosin microfilaments, cell spreading, and cell migration. Interestingly, the CB1 inactivation with the selective CB1 antagonist AM251 significantly increases RhoA activity, enhances microfilament formation and cell spreading, and promotes cell migration. This finding suggests that endogenously produced EC activate the CB1, resulting in chronic repression of RhoA activity and cell migration. Consistent with this possibility, RhoA activity is significantly diminished by the exogenous application of AEA but not by 2-AG in PC-3 cells (cells with very low AEA hydrolysis). Pretreatment of cells with a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, JZL184, which blocks 2-AG hydrolysis, decreases the RhoA activity. These results indicate the unique CB1 signaling and support the model that EC, through their autocrine activation of CB1 and subsequent repression of RhoA activity, suppress migration in prostate carcinoma cells.},

Chemoattractive turning of the growth cone triggered by a gradient of ryanodine was blocked by overexpression of mutant forms of Cdc42 but not of RhoA in Xenopus spinal cord neurons. Furthermore, Ca2+-induced GTPase activity correlated with activation of protein kinase C and required a basal activity of Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Thus, Rho GTPases may mediate axon guidance by linking upstream Ca2+ signals triggered by guidance factors to downstream cytoskeletal rearrangements. Copyright © 2005 Society for Neuroscience.},

   abstract = {The human cannabinoid receptor CB1 functionally couples primarily to G(i)-, but also to G(s)-mediated pathways to modulate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. To probe the features of the receptor that may be involved in promoting interactions with one G protein type over another, we generated the L341A/A342L mutant CB1 receptor. The double mutation involved the swap in position of two adjacent residues in the carboxyl-terminal segment of the third intracellular loop of CB1. This resulted in partial constitutive activation of the receptor and an agonist-independent enhancement in cAMP levels. Characterization following treatment with either pertussis or cholera toxin indicated that the constitutive activity is selective for a G(s)- and not a G(i)-mediated pathway. Treatment with the CB1-specific inverse agonist SR141716A inhibited the basal accumulation of cAMP in the presence of pertussis toxin, establishing that the effect is CB1 mediated. The binding of the agonist CP-55,940 to the L341A/A342L receptor was not markedly different from that for the wild-type receptor despite the constitutive G(s) activity. This may reflect a preference of this ligand for an activated receptor state associated with the G(i) coupling form and underscores the potential for developing therapeutics that selectively activate one pathway over another.},

In particulate preparations of Drosophila melanogaster heads, only one substrate for pertussis toxin at 39-40 kd was detected. This substrate, which showed only one isoform when analysed by isoelectric focusing, was recognized by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation techniques using a polyclonal antibody against the α subunit of the G(o) protein purified from bovine brain and can be thus considered as a G(o)-like protein. Antibodies obtained against a carboxy-terminal sequence of the α subunit of G(o) (but not of G(i1) or G(i2)) and against an internal sequence shared by all the α subunits, were also able to cross-react with the α subunit of this protein in insects. We have also studied that G(o)-like protein in several D. melanogaster mutants, primarily in memory and learning mutants. In these mutants there was a sex-dependent enhancement in pertussis toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation with respect to the wild-type. This increase could be attributed in part to an increase in the α subunit of the G(o)-like protein, as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-G(oα) polyclonal antibody.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoid signaling system is involved in regulating multiple neuronal functions in the central nervous system by activating G-protein coupled cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors (CB1Rs and CB2Rs). Growing evidence has shown that CB1Rs and CB2Rs are extensively expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here, modulation of L- and T-types Ca2+ channels by activating CB1Rs and CB2Rs in RGCs was investigated. Triple immunofluorescent staining showed that L-type subunit CaV1.2 was co-localized with T-type subunits (CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3) in rat RGCs. In acutely isolated rat RGCs, the CB1R agonist WIN55212-2 suppressed both peak and steady-state Ca2+ currents in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 being 9.6 μM and 8.4 μM, respectively. It was further shown that activation of CB1Rs by WIN55212-2 or ACEA, another CB1R agonist, significantly suppressed both L- and T-type Ca2+ currents, and shifted inactivation curve of T-type one toward hyperpolarization direction. While the effect on L-type Ca2+ channels was mediated by intracellular cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling pathways, only CaMKII signaling pathway was involved in the effect on T-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, CB65 and HU308, two specific CB2R agonists, significantly suppressed T-type Ca2+ channels, which was mediated by intracellular cAMP/PKA and CaMKII signaling pathways, but had no effect on L-type channels. These results imply that endogenous cannabinoids may modulate the excitability and the output of RGCs by differentially suppressing the activity of L- and T-type Ca2+ channels through activation of CB1Rs and CB2Rs.

   abstract = {The properties of voltage-dependent calcium currents were compared in thalamic neurons acutely dissociated from a rat model of absence epilepsy, designated as Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), and from a Nonepileptic Control strain (NEC). Two populations of neurons were isolated: thalamocortical relay neurons of the nucleus ventrobasalis (VB) and neurons of the nucleus reticularis (RT) of the thalamus. Whole-cell patch- clamp analysis demonstrated an increase in the amplitude of the calcium (Ca2+) current with a low threshold of activation (I(T)) in RT neurons of GAERS in comparison to that of the seizure-free rat strain (198 ± 19 pA and -128 ± 14 pA, respectively), whereas the sustained component (I(L)) was not significantly different. The kinetic properties, voltage dependence, and basic pharmacological sensitivity of the Ca2+ conductances were similar in the two populations of neurons. The amplitude of both I(T) and I(L) in RT neurons increased after birth, and differences in I(T) between GAERS and NEC attained significance after postnatal day 11. At corresponding ages, the Ca2+ currents in VB thalamocortical relay neurons were not altered in GAERS in comparison to those in NEC. We conclude that the selective increase in I(T) of RT neurons enhances the probability of recurrent intrathalamic burst activity, thereby strengthening the synchronizing mechanisms in thalamocortical systems, and, as such, represents a possible primary neuronal dysfunction that relates to the pathological increase in synchronization underlying the generation of bilateral and synchronous spike and wave discharges (SWDs) in an established genetic model of generalized epilepsy.},

THC is the prototypic cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist and is psychoactive and analgesic. CBD is also analgesic, but it is not a CB1 receptor agonist. Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels, encoded by the CaV3 gene family, regulate the excitability of many cells, including neurons involved in nociceptive processing. We examined the effects of THC and CBD on human Ca V3 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and T-type channels in mouse sensory neurons using whole-cell, patch clamp recordings. At moderately hyperpolarized potentials, THC and CBD inhibited peak CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents with IC50 values of ∼1 μM but were less potent on CaV3.3 channels. THC and CBD inhibited sensory neuron T-type channels by about 45% at 1 μM. However, in recordings made from a holding potential of -70 mV, 100 nM THC or CBD inhibited more than 50% of the peak CaV3.1 current. THC and CBD produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the steady state inactivation potentials for each of the CaV3 channels, which accounts for inhibition of channel currents. Additionally, THC caused a modest hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of CaV3.1 and CaV3.2. THC but not CBD slowed CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 deactivation and inactivation kinetics. Thus, THC and CBD inhibit CaV3 channels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, THC, but not CBD, may also increase the amount of calcium entry following T-type channel activation by stabilizing open states of the channel. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: Numerous claims are made for cannabis' therapeutic utility upon human seizures, but concerns persist about risks. A potential confounder is the presence of both Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), variously reported to be pro- and anticonvulsant, and cannabidiol (CBD), widely confirmed as anticonvulsant. Therefore, we investigated effects of prolonged exposure to different THC/CBD cannabis extracts on seizure activity and associated measures of endocannabinoid (eCB) system signalling. Experimental Approach: Cannabis extract effects on in vivo neurological and behavioural responses, and on bioanalyte levels, were measured in rats and dogs. Extract effects on seizure activity were measured using electroencephalography telemetry in rats. eCB signalling was also investigated using radioligand binding in cannabis extract-treated rats and treatment-naïve rat, mouse, chicken, dog and human tissue. Key Results: Prolonged exposure to cannabis extracts caused spontaneous, generalized seizures, subserved by epileptiform discharges in rats, but not dogs, and produced higher THC, but lower 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and CBD, plasma concentrations in rats versus dogs. In the same rats, prolonged exposure to cannabis also impaired cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1 receptor)-mediated signalling. Profiling CB1 receptor expression, basal activity, extent of activation and sensitivity to THC suggested interspecies differences in eCB signalling, being more pronounced in a species that exhibited cannabis extract-induced seizures (rat) than one that did not (dog). Conclusions and Implications: Sustained cannabis extract treatment caused differential seizure, behavioural and bioanalyte levels between rats and dogs. Supporting radioligand binding data suggest species differences in eCB signalling. Interspecies variations may have important implications for predicting cannabis-induced convulsions from animal models.

The CB(1) cannabinoid receptor was immunoprecipitated from 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate-solubilized rat brain membranes using an antibody against the CB(1) receptor N terminus. The CB(1) receptor was coimmunoprecipitated with its associated G proteins, specifically those of the Galpha(i/o) family, but not Galpha(s), Galpha(q), or Galpha(z). The CB(1) receptor-Galpha(i/o) complex existed in the absence of exogenous agonists, and the cannabinoid receptor agonist desacetyllevonantradol failed to alter the stoichiometry of the receptor-Galpha(i/o) interaction. Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate could disrupt the interaction. A peptide derived from the CB(1) receptor juxtamembrane C-terminal domain, peptide CB(1)401-417, autonomously activates G(i/o) proteins. Peptide CB(1)401-417 competitively disrupted the CB(1) receptor association with Galpha(o) and Galpha(i3) but not Galpha(i1) or Galpha(i2). This G protein specificity was also observed in detergent extracts from membranes of the frontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum. Alternative peptides, including peptides from the CB(1) receptor third intracellular loop and the G protein activating peptide mastoparan-7, failed to promote uncoupling from Galpha(o). A CB(2) receptor juxtamembrane C-terminal peptide failed to disrupt the CB(1) receptor-Galpha(o) complex. These studies illustrate that the CB(1) receptor can exist as an SDS-resistant multimer. In 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate detergent, the CB(1) receptor exists in a complex with G proteins of the G(i/o) family in the absence of exogenous agonists. Furthermore, this study provides the first description of domain specificity for interaction with a selective set of G proteins.},

   abstract = {Biphasic effects of cannabinoids have been shown in processes such as feeding behavior, motor activity, motivational processes and anxiety responses. Using two different tests for the characterization of anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus-maze and holeboard), we first identified in wild-type C57BL/6N mice, two doses of the synthetic CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist CP-55,940 with anxiolytic (1 μg/kg) and anxiogenic properties (50 μg/kg), respectively. To clarify the role of CB1 receptors in this biphasic effect, both doses were applied to two different conditional CB1 receptor knockout (KO) mouse lines, GABA-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in forebrain GABAergic neurons) and Glu-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in cortical glutamatergic neurons). We found that the anxiolytic-like effects of the low dose of cannabinoids are mediated via the CB1 receptor on cortical glutamatergic terminals, because this anxiolytic-like response was abrogated only in Glu-CB1-KO mice. On the contrary, the CB1 receptor on the GABAergic terminals is required to induce an anxiogenic-like effect under a high-dose treatment because of the fact that this effect was abolished specifically in GABA-CB1-KO mice. These experiments were carried out in both sexes, and no differences occurred with the doses tested in the mutant mice. Interestingly, the positive allosteric modulation of GABA B receptor with GS-39783 was found to largely abrogate the anxiogenic-like effect of the high dose of CP-55,940. Our results shed new light in further understanding the biphasic effects of cannabinoids at the molecular level and, importantly, pave the way for the development of novel anxiolytic cannabinoid drugs, which may have favorable effect profiles targeting the CB1 receptor on glutamatergic terminals. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

The nature of specific signal initiators, nuclear translocators and effectors has become increasingly clear, and supports the idea that the nucleus is able to make sense of a surprising amount of fast synaptic information through intricate biochemical mechanisms. Information transfer to the nucleus can be conveyed by physical translocation of messengers at various stages within the multiple signal transduction cascades that are set in motion by a Ca2+ rise near the surface membrane. The key role of synapse-to-nucleus signaling in circadian rhythms, long-term memory, and neuronal survival sheds light on the logical underpinning of these signaling mechanisms.},

   abstract = {5-HT2-type serotonin receptors (5-HT2Rs) are widely expressed throughout the brain and mediate many of the modulatory effects of serotonin. It has been thought that postsynaptic 5-HT2Rs act primarily by depolarizing neurons and thereby increasing their excitability. However, it is also known that 5-HT2Rs are coupled to G q/11-type G-proteins and that some other types of G q/11-coupled receptors can regulate synapses by evoking endocannabinoid release and activating presynaptic cannabinoid-type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). Here, we examine whether activation of 5-HT2Rs can regulate synapses through such a mechanism by studying excitatory synapses onto cells in the inferior olive (IO). These cells express 5-HT2Rs on their soma and dendrites, and the IO receives extensive serotonergic input.Wefind that the excitatory synaptic inputs onto IO cells are strongly suppressed by serotonin receptor agonists as well as release of endogenous serotonin. Both 5-HT2Rs and 5-HT1BRs contribute to this modulation by decreasing the probability of glutamate release from presynaptic boutons. The suppression by 5-HT2Rs is of particular interest because it is prevented by CB1R antagonists, and 5-HT2Rs are thought to be located only postsynaptically on IO cells. Our results indicate that serotonin activates 5-HT2Rs on IO neurons, thereby releasing endocannabinoids that act retrogradely to suppress glutamate release by activating presynaptic CB1Rs. These findings establish a link between serotonin signaling and endocannabinoid signaling. Based on the extensive distribution of 5-HT2Rs and CB1Rs, it seems likely that this mechanism could mediate many of the actions of 5-HT2Rs throughout the brain.

Normal human volunteers who do not use marijuana have genes that encode for the marijuana (cannabinoid) receptor proteins. 3.

This suggest that the CB1 and CB2 genes are intronless at least in their coding regions. 4. An advantage of the coding region being intronless may be that the expression of these genes will have one major RNA processing event to skip, thus making the conditions of their expression relatively quick and simple. This advantages may have implications related to the biological functions of these proteins. 5. We therefore concluded that the existence of human cannabinoid receptors and genes along with the discovery of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) may be useful markers in elucidating the role(s) and mechanism(s) of action of cannabinoids.},

   abstract = {Drugs that increase GABA levels in the brain reduce cocaine seeking in rodents and humans, suggesting that GABAergic inhibition regulates cocaine-seeking behavior. We previously reported that repeated cocaine exposure in vivo facilitates long-term potentiation by reducing the strength of GABAergic inhibition in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Selective blockade of cocaine-induced reduction of GABAergic inhibition in the VTA might diminish cocaine-induced aberrant synaptic plasticity and addictive behavior. Here, we investigated the mechanism for cocaine-induced reduction of GABAergic inhibition. We show that a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of cocaine enables a normally ineffective stimulus to induce long-term depression (LTD) of IPSCs (I-LTD) in VTA dopamine neurons of midbrain slices. Activation of D2 dopamine receptors and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent recruitment of endocannabinoid signaling are required for I-LTD induction. We further demonstrate that in vivo pretreatment with antagonists to these receptors blocks cocaine-induced reduction of GABAergic inhibition and that repeated cocaine exposure in vivo occludes the subsequent induction of I-LTD ex vivo. Together, these results suggest that repeated cocaine exposure reduces the strength of GABAergic inhibition in dopamine neurons by inducing I-LTD-like modification in vivo.

   abstract = {Synapses may undergo long-term increases or decreases in synaptic strength dependent on critical differences in the timing between pre-and postsynaptic activity. Such spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) follows rules that govern how patterns of neural activity induce changes in synaptic strength. Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) follows Hebbian and anti-Hebbian patterns in a cell-specific manner. Here we show that these opposing responses to synaptic activity result from differential expression of two signaling pathways. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling underlies Hebbian postsynaptic LTP in principal cells. By contrast, in interneurons, a temporally precise anti-Hebbian synaptic spike-timing rule results from the combined effects of postsynaptic CaMKII-dependent LTP and endocannabinoid-dependent presynaptic LTD. Cell specificity in the circuit arises from selective targeting of presynaptic CB1 receptors in different axonal terminals. Hence, pre- and postsynaptic sites of expression determine both the sign and timing requirements of long-term plasticity in interneurons. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Here we demonstrate that cerebellar stellate cells diffusionally isolate synaptically evoked signals in dendrites and are capable of input-specific synaptic plasticity. Sustained activity of parallel fibers induces a form of long-term depression that requires opening of calcium (Ca2+)- permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) and signaling through class 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1) and CB1 receptors. This depression is induced by postsynaptic increases in Ca2+ concentration ([Ca 2+]) and is limited to activated synapses. To understand how synapse-specific plasticity is induced by diffusible second messengers in aspiny dendrites, we examined diffusion of Ca2+ and small molecules within stellate cell dendrites. Activation of a single parallel fiber opened CP-AMPARs, generating long-lived Ca2+ transients that were confined to submicron dendritic stretches. The diffusion of Ca2+ was severely retarded due to interactions with parvalbumin and a general restriction of small molecule mobility. Thus stellate cell dendrites spatially restrict signaling cascades that lead from CP-AMPAR activation to endocannabinoid production and trigger the selective regulation of active synapses. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce a wide array of extracellular signals and regulate virtually every aspect of physiology. While GPCR signaling is essential, overstimulation can be deleterious, resulting in cellular toxicity or uncontrolled cellular growth. Accordingly, nature has developed a number of mechanisms for limiting GPCR signaling, which are broadly referred to as desensitization, and refer to a decrease in response to repeated or continuous stimulation. Short-term desensitization occurs over minutes, and is primarily associated with β-arrestins preventing G protein interaction with a GPCR. Longer-term desensitization, referred to as downregulation, occurs over hours to days, and involves receptor internalization into vesicles, degradation in lysosomes and decreased receptor mRNA levels through unclear mechanisms. Phosphorylation of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and the recruitment of β-arrestins is critical to both these short- and long-term desensitization mechanisms. In addition to phosphorylation, both the GPCR and β-arrestins are modified post-translationally in several ways, including by ubiquitination. For many GPCRs, receptor ubiquitination promotes degradation of agonist-activated receptors in the lysosomes. Other proteins also play important roles in desensitization, including phosphodiesterases, RGS family proteins and A-kinase-anchoring proteins. Together, this intricate network of kinases, ubiquitin ligases, and adaptor proteins orchestrate the acute and prolonged desensitization of GPCRs.},

   abstract = {Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main source of the pharmacological effects caused by the consumption of cannabis, both the marijuana-like action and the medicinal benefits of the plant. However, its acid metabolite THC-COOH, the non-psychotropic cannabidiol (CBD), several cannabinoid analogues and newly discovered modulators of the endogenous cannabinoid system are also promising candidates for clinical research and therapeutic uses. Cannabinoids exert many effects through activation of G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues. Additionally, there is evidence for non-receptor-dependent mechanisms. Natural cannabis products and single cannabinoids are usually inhaled or taken orally; the rectal route, sublingual administration, transdermal delivery, eye drops and aerosols have only been used in a few studies and are of little relevance in practice today. The pharmacokinetics of THC vary as a function of its route of administration. Pulmonary assimilation of inhaled THC causes a maximum plasma concentration within minutes, psychotropic effects start within seconds to a few minutes, reach a maximum after 15-30 minutes, and taper off within 2-3 hours. Following oral ingestion, psychotropic effects set in with a delay of 30-90 minutes, reach their maximum after 2-3 hours and last for about 4-12 hours, depending on dose and specific effect. At doses exceeding the psychotropic threshold, ingestion of cannabis usually causes enhanced well-being and relaxation with an intensification of ordinary sensory experiences. The most important acute adverse effects caused by overdosing are anxiety and panic attacks, and with regard to somatic effects increased heart rate and changes in blood pressure. Regular use of cannabis may lead to dependency and to a mild withdrawal syndrome. The existence and the intensity of possible long-term adverse effects on psyche and cognition, immune system, fertility and pregnancy remain controversial. They are reported to be low in humans and do not preclude legitimate therapeutic use of cannabis-based drugs. Properties of cannabis that might be of therapeutic use include analgesia, muscle relaxation, immunosuppression, sedation, improvement of mood, stimulation of appetite, antiemesis, lowering of intraocular pressure, bronchodilation, neuroprotection and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.},

   abstract = {Tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of cannabinoids represents a significant limitation to their clinical use in managing chronic pain. Tolerance likely results from desensitization and down-regulation of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), with CB1R desensitization occurring via phosphorylation of CB1Rs by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase and subsequent association with an arrestin protein. Previous studies have shown that (1) desensitization-resistant S426A/S430A mice exhibit a modest delay in tolerance for Δ9-THC and (-)-CP55,940 but a more pronounced disruption in tolerance for WIN 55,212-2 and (2) that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling may selectively mediate antinociceptive tolerance to morphine compared to other opioid analgesics. In the current study, we found that pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (3 mg/kg) attenuates tolerance to the antinociceptive in the formalin test and to the anti-allodynic effects of Δ9-THC (6 mg/kg) in cisplatin-evoked neuropathic pain using wild-type mice. We also find that SP600125 causes an especially robust reduction in tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of Δ9-THC (30 mg/kg), but not WIN 55,212-2 (10 mg/kg) in the tail-flick assay using S426A/S430A mice. Interestingly, SP600125 pretreatment accelerated tolerance to the antinociceptive and anti-allodynic effects of (-)-CP55,940 (0.3 mg/kg) in mice with acute and neuropathic pain. These results demonstrate that inhibition of JNK signaling pathways delay tolerance to Δ9-THC, but not to CP55,940 or WIN55,212-2, demonstrating that the mechanisms of cannabinoid tolerance are agonist-specific.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid agonists have shown some promise clinically as analgesics, in particular for cancer pain, in which they have the additional benefit of decreasing nausea. However, as for most other drugs, the long-term use of cannabinoids is limited by the development of tolerance. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain drug tolerance, including receptor downregulation. The cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors can be downregulated in vitro through an interaction with the G-protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein1, GASP1, that targets CB1 receptors for degradation after their agonist-mediated endocytosis. To investigate whether GASP1-mediated postendocytic sorting of the CB1 receptor contributes to tolerance to cannabinoid drugs in vivo, we generated a mouse with a disruption of GASP1. In wild-type mice, repeated administration of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 promoted downregulation of CB1 receptor levels and concomitant tolerance to the effects of drug on antinociception, motor incoordination, and locomotor hypoactivity. In contrast, GASP1 knockout mice did not develop tolerance to any of these effects and showed no significant receptor downregulation. Taken together, this study provides evidence that GASP1 regulates CB1 receptor downregulation in vivo, and that postendocytic receptor trafficking has a key role in the development of tolerance to WIN55,212-2. © 2010 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Context: Previous studies have indicated a role for beta-arrestin2 in the regulation of brain cannabinoid effects and cannabinoid CB1 receptors, but whether beta-arrestin1 has a role has not been investigated. Objective: To determine the role of beta-arrestin1 in cannabinoid activity. Materials and methods: Beta-arrestin1-/-mice and their wild-type (+/+) counterparts were assayed for antinociceptive and temperature-decreasing effects of two ligands, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CP55940, after both single and repeated administration. In vitro assays examined the effects of deletion on CB1 receptor density, agonist-binding and G-protein activation. Results: Deletion of beta-arrestin1 diminished the effects of CP55940 in both antinociception (latency to tail withdrawal) and temperature-depression assays in mice. However, deleting beta-arrestin1 had no effect on the actions of THC in either assay. Antagonist radioligand ([H]SR141716A) saturation binding indicated no difference between beta-arrestin1 +/+ and-/-mice in the density or affinity for cannabinoid CB1 receptors in brain membranes. CP55940 agonist binding in brain membranes from beta-arrestin1 +/+ mice exhibited high-and intermediate-affinity sites, but beta-arrestin1-/-membranes exhibited an additional site with low affinity. CP55940 produced greater stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes from whole brain of beta-arrestin1-/-than +/+ mice. The rates of the development of tolerance to chronic THC or CP55940 administration did not appear to be affected by genotype. Discussion: Beta-arrestin1 appeared to mediate the actions of CP55940, but did not affect the activity of THC. Conclusion: Beta-arrestin1 regulates cannabinoid CB1 receptor sensitivity in an agonist-selective manner, but may not be the primary mediator of tolerance to cannabinoid agonists.},

   abstract = {Background: Cannabinoid CB 1 receptors (CB 1Rs) mediate the effects of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in marijuana. Repeated THC administration produces tolerance and dependence, which limit therapeutic development. Moreover, THC produces motor and psychoactive side effects. β-arrestin2 mediates receptor desensitization, internalization, and signaling, but its role in these CB 1R effects and receptor regulation is unclear. Methods: CB 1R signaling and behaviors (antinociception, hypothermia, catalepsy) were assessed in β-arrestin2-knockout (βarr2-KO) and wild-type mice after THC administration. Cannabinoid-stimulated [ 35S]GTPγS and [ 3H]ligand autoradiography were assessed by statistical parametric mapping and region-of-interest analysis. Results: β-arrestin2 deletion increased CB 1R-mediated G-protein activity in subregions of the cortex but did not affect CB 1R binding, in vehicle-treated mice. βarr2-KO mice exhibited enhanced acute THC-mediated antinociception and hypothermia, with no difference in catalepsy. After repeated THC administration, βarr2-KO mice showed reduced CB 1R desensitization and/or downregulation in cerebellum, caudal periaqueductal gray, and spinal cord and attenuated tolerance to THC-mediated antinociception. In contrast, greater desensitization was found in hypothalamus, cortex, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra of βarr2-KO compared with wild-type mice. Enhanced tolerance to THC-induced catalepsy was observed in βarr2-KO mice. Conclusions: β-arrestin2 regulation of CB 1R signaling following acute and repeated THC administration was region-specific, and results suggest that multiple, overlapping mechanisms regulate CB 1Rs. The observations that βarr2-KO mice display enhanced antinociceptive responses to acute THC and decreased tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of the drug, yet enhanced tolerance to catalepsy, suggest that development of cannabinoid drugs that minimize CB 1R interactions with β-arrestin2 might produce improved cannabinoid analgesics with reduced motor suppression. © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

   abstract = {Neurons intensively exchange information among each other using both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. However, if the balance of excitation and inhibition is perturbed, the intensity of excitatory transmission may exceed a certain threshold and epileptic seizures can occur. As the occurrence of epilepsy in the human population is about 1%, the search for therapeutic targets to alleviate seizures is warranted. Extracts of Cannabis sativa have a long history in the treatment of various neurological diseases, including epilepsy. However, cannabinoids have been reported to exert both pro- and anti-convulsive activities. The recent progress in understanding the endogenous cannabinoid system has allowed new insights into these opposing effects of cannabinoids. When excessive neuronal activity occurs, endocannabinoids are generated on demand and activate cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. Using mice lacking CB1 receptors in principal forebrain neurons in a model of epileptiform seizures, it was shown that CB1 receptors expressed on excitatory glutamatergic neurons mediate the anti-convulsive activity of endocannabinoids. Systemic activation of CB1 receptors by exogenous cannabinoids, however, are anti- or pro-convulsive, depending on the seizure model used. The pro-convulsive activity of exogenous cannabinoids might be explained by the notion that CB1 receptors expressed on inhibitory GABAergic neurons are also activated, leading to a decreased release of GABA, and to a concomitant increase in seizure susceptibility. The concept that the endogenous cannabinoid system is activated on demand suggests that a promising strategy to alleviate seizure frequency is the enhancement of endocannabinoid levels by inhibiting the cellular uptake and the degradation of these endogenous compounds. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Several reports have focused on the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in hyperexcitability, particularly in seizure and epilepsy models. Our laboratory recently characterized a novel plasticity change of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor in hippocampi of epileptic rats following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). This long-term redistribution included selective layer-specific changes in CB1 receptor expression within distinct hippocampal subregions. However, the temporal characteristics of this redistribution during the development of epilepsy had not been examined. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the time course by which pilocarpine-induced SE produced changes in CB1 receptor expression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that within 1 week following SE, there was a pronounced loss in CB1 receptor expression throughout the hippocampus, while staining in many interneurons was preserved. By 1 month post-SE, pilocarpine-treated animals began to display epileptic seizures, and CB1 receptor expression was characteristic of the redistribution observed in long-term epileptic rats, with decreases in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale neuropil and dentate gyrus inner molecular layer, and increases in the strata oriens and radiatum of CA1-3. Observed changes in CB1 receptor expression were confirmed at multiple time points by western blot analysis. The data indicate that overall decreases in expression following SE preempt a long-lasting CB1 receptor redistribution, and that differential responses occur within the hippocampus to initial CB1 receptor losses. This suggests a role for dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system during epileptogenesis and indicates that the CB1 receptor redistribution temporally correlates with the emergence of epileptic seizures.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system plays a central role in retrograde synaptic communication, and controls both glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission via type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Both in sclerotic human hippocampi and in the chronic phase of pilocarpineinduced epilepsy in mice with sclerosis, CB1-receptor-positive interneuron somata were preserved both in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 area, and the density of CB1-immunostained fibers increased considerably in the dentate molecular layer. This suggests that, although CB1 receptors are known to be reduced in density on glutamatergic axons, the CB1-receptor-expressing GABAergic axons sprout, or there is an increase of CB1-receptor levels on these fibers. The changes of CB1 immunostaining in association with the GABAergic inhibitory system appear to correlate with the severity of pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 subfield. These results confirmthe involvement of the endocannabinoid system associated with GABAergic transmission in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model in mice. Pharmacotherapy aimed at the modulation of endocannabinoidmediated retrograde synaptic signaling should take into account the opposite change in CB1-receptor expression observed on glutamatergic versus GABAergic axon terminals. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.},

However, the anticonvulsant potential of cannabinoids and, moreover, the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity has not been tested in an in vivo model of epilepsy that is characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Here, using the rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that the marijuana extract Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 mg/kg) as well as the cannabimimetic, 4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-4(4-morpholinylmethyl)-1-(1-naphthalenyl-carbonyl) -6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-i,j]quinolin-6-one [R(+)WIN55,212 (5 mg/kg)], completely abolished spontaneous epileptic seizures. Conversely, application of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1) antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) -4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A), significantly increased both seizure duration and frequency. In some animals, CB1 receptor antagonism resulted in seizure durations that were protracted to a level consistent with the clinical condition status epilepticus. Furthermore, we determined that during an short-term pilocarpine-induced seizure, levels of the endogenous CB1 ligand 2-arachidonylglycerol increased significantly within the hippocampal brain region. These data indicate not only anticonvulsant activity of exogenously applied cannabinoids but also suggest that endogenous cannabinoid tone modulates seizure termination and duration through activation of the CB1 receptor. Furthermore, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that CB1 receptor protein expression was significantly increased throughout the CA regions of epileptic hippocampi. By demonstrating a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity, these studies define a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in modulating neuroexcitation and suggest that plasticity of the CB1 receptor occurs with epilepsy.},

Surprisingly, mutant mice exhibited increased seizure susceptibility, and the activation of neuroprotective mechanisms was impaired. We found that endocannabinoid levels were reduced under both basal and excitotoxic conditions and that increased susceptibility to kainic acid could be normalized by the enhancement of endocannabinoid levels with an endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor, while the competitive cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist SR141716A did not cause further aggravation. These findings indicate that G q /G 11 family G proteins negatively regulate neuronal excitability in vivo and suggest that impaired endocannabinoid formation in the absence of G q /G 11 contributes to this phenotype. },

   abstract = {Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is an endocannabinoid-mediated short-term plasticity mechanism that couples postsynaptic Ca2+ rises to decreased presynaptic GABA release. Whether the gain of this retrograde synaptic mechanism is subject to long-term modulation by glutamatergic excitatory inputs is not known. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent long-term DSI potentiation takes place in hippocampal slices after tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collateral synapses. This activity-dependent, long-term plasticity of endocannabinoid signaling was specific to GABAergic synapses, as it occurred without increases in the depolarization-induced suppression of excitation. Induction of tetanus-induced DSI potentiation in vitro required a complex pathway involving AMPA/kainate and metabotropic glutamate receptor as well as CB1 receptor activation. Because DSI potentiation has been suggested to play a role in persistent limbic hyperexcitability after prolonged seizures in the developing brain, we used these mechanistic insights into activity-dependent DSI potentiation to test whether interference with the induction of DSI potentiation prevents seizure-induced longterm hyperexcitability. The results showed that the in vitro, tetanus-induced DSI potentiation was occluded by previous in vivo feverinduced (febrile) seizures, indicating a common pathway. Accordingly, application of CB1 receptor antagonists during febrile seizures in vivo blocked the seizure-induced persistent DSI potentiation, abolished the seizure-induced upregulation of CB1 receptors, and prevented the emergence of long-term limbic hyperexcitability. These results reveal a new form of activity-dependent, long-term plasticity of endocannabinoid signaling at perisomatic GABAergic synapses, and demonstrate that blocking the induction of this plasticity abolishes the long-term effects of prolonged febrile seizures in the developing brain.

The magnitude and time course of endocannabinoid signaling are thought to depend on the balance between the production and degradation of endocannabinoids. The major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), which is shown to be localized at axon terminals. In the present study, we investigated how MGL regulates endocannabinoid signaling and influences synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We found that MGL inhibitors, methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate and arachidonoyl trifluoromethylketone, caused a gradual suppression of cannabinoid-sensitive IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. This suppression was reversed by blocking CB1 receptors and was attenuated by inhibiting 2-AG synthesis, indicating that MGL scavenges constitutively released 2-AG. We also found that the MGL inhibitors significantly prolonged the suppression of both IPSCs and EPSCs induced by exogenous 2-AG and depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition/excitation, a phenomenon known to be mediated by retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. In contrast, inhibitors of other endocannabinoid hydrolyzing enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase and cyclooxygenase-2, had no effect on the 2-AG-induced IPSC suppression. These results strongly suggest that presynaptic MGL not only hydrolyzes 2-AG released from activated postsynaptic neurons but also contributes to degradation of constitutively produced 2-AG and prevention of its accumulation around presynaptic terminals. Thus, the MGL activity determines basal endocannabinoid tone and terminates retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the hippocampus. Copyright © 2007 Society for Neuroscience.},

   abstract = {N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are membrane-derived lipids that are utilized as signaling molecules in the nervous system (e.g., the endocannabinoid anandamide). An N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) that catalyzes formation of NAEs was recently identified as a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family of enzymes. NAPE-PLD-/- mice have greatly reduced brain levels of long-chain saturated NAEs but wild-type levels of polyunsaturated NAEs (e.g., anandamide), suggesting an important role for NAPE-PLD in the biosynthesis of at least a subset of endogenous NAEs in the mammalian nervous system. To provide a neuroanatomical basis for investigation of NAPE-PLD function, here we have analyzed expression of NAPE-PLD in the mouse brain using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. NAPE-PLD -/- mice were utilized to establish the specificity of probes/antibodies used. The most striking feature of NAPE-PLD expression in the brain was in the dentate gyrus, where a strong mRNA signal was detected in granule cells. Accordingly, immunocytochemical analysis revealed intense NAPE-PLD immunoreactivity in the axons of granule cells (mossy fibers). Intense NAPE-PLD immunoreactivity was also detected in axons of the vomeronasal nerve that project to the accessory olfactory bulb. NAPE-PLD expression was detected in other brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus), but the intensity of immunostaining was weaker than in mossy fibers. Collectively, the data obtained indicate that NAPE-PLD is expressed by specific populations of neurons in the brain and targeted to axonal processes. We suggest that NAEs generated by NAPE-PLD in axons may act as anterograde synaptic signaling molecules that regulate the activity of postsynaptic neurons. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We utilized unmodified Sepharose-4B as a specific adsorbent and 0.2 M lactose solution as an elution buffer. Fusion proteins of LSL-tag and porcine circovirus capsid protein, designated LSL-Cap was recovered with purity of 90 ± 4%, and yield of 87 ± 3% from crude extract of recombinant Escherichia coli. To enable the remove of LSL-tag, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence was placed downstream of LSL-tag in the expression vector, and LSL-tagged TEV protease, designated LSL-TEV, was also expressed in E. coli., and was recovered with purity of 82 ± 5%, and yield of 85 ± 2% from crude extract of recombinant E. coli. After digestion of LSL-tagged recombinant proteins with LSL-TEV, the LSL tag and LSL-TEV can be easily removed by passing the digested products through the Sepharose column. It is of worthy noting that the Sepharose can be reused after washing with PBS. The LSL affinity purification method enables rapid and inexpensive purification of LSL-tagged fusion proteins and scale-up production of native proteins.},

Cannabinoids inhibit neurotransmitter release via specific presynaptic cannabinoid CB 1 receptors.

Target selectivity and off-target side effects are two major limiting factors for orthosteric ligands, and therefore, the search for allosteric modulators (AMs) is a widely used drug discovery approach. To date, only a limited number of negative CB2 AMs have been identified, possessing only micromolar activity at best, and the CB2 receptor’s allosteric site(s) are not well characterized. Herein, we used computational approaches including receptor modeling, site mapping, docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations to predict, characterize and validate allosteric sites within the complex of the CB2 receptor with bound orthosteric agonist CP55,940. After docking of known negative CB2 allosteric modulators (NAMs), dihydro-gambogic acid (DHGA) and trans-β-caryophyllene (TBC) (note that TBC also shows agonist activity), at the predicted allosteric sites, the best total complex with CB2, CP55,940 and NAM was embedded into a hydrated lipid bilayer and subjected to a 200 ns MD simulation. The presence of an AM affected the CB2–CP55,940 complex, altering the relative positioning of the toggle switch residues and promoting a strong π–π interaction between Phe1173.36 and Trp2586.48. Binding of either TBC or DHGA to a putative allosteric pocket directly adjacent to the orthosteric ligand reduced the binding free energy of CP55,940, which is consistent with the expected effect of a negative AM. The identified allosteric sites present immense scope for the discovery of novel classes of CB2 AMs.},

   abstract = {The type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) was initially regarded as a peripheral cannabinoid receptor. However, recent technological advances in gene detection, alongside the availability of transgenic mouse lines, indicate that CB2Rs are expressed in both neurons and glial cells in the brain under physiological and pathological conditions, and are involved in multiple functions at cellular and behavioral levels. Brain CB2Rs are inducible and neuroprotective via up-regulation in response to various insults, but display species differences in gene and receptor structures, CB2R expression, and receptor responses to various CB2R ligands. CB2R transcripts also differ between the brain and spleen. In the brain, CB 2A is the major transcript isoform, while CB 2A and CB 2B transcripts are present at higher levels in the spleen. These new findings regarding brain versus spleen CB2R isoforms may in part explain why early studies failed to detect brain CB2R gene expression. Here, we review evidence supporting the expression and function of brain CB2R from gene and receptor levels to cellular functioning, neural circuitry, and animal behavior.},

Further structural analyses with computational docking results uncover the differences between CB2 and CB1 in receptor activation, ligand recognition, and Gi coupling.

Noradrenergic neurons have been identified to be a specific site of pepcan production. However, it remains unknown whether pepcans occur in the periphery and interact with peripheral CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Here, it is shown that pepcan-12 acts as a potent (K i value ~50 nM) hCB2 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). It significantly potentiated the effects of CB2 receptor agonists, including the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), for [35S]GTPγS binding and cAMP inhibition (5-10 fold). In mice, the putative precursor pepcan-23 (SALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSH) was identified with pepcan-12 in brain, liver and kidney. Pepcan-12 was increased upon endotoxemia and ischemia reperfusion damage where CB2 receptors play a protective role. The adrenals are a major endocrine site of production/secretion of constitutive pepcan-12, as shown by its marked loss after adrenalectomy. However, upon I/R damage pepcan-12 was strongly increased in the liver (from ~100 pmol/g to ~500 pmol/g) independent of adrenals. The wide occurrence of this endogenous hormone-like CB2 receptor PAM, with unforeseen opposite allosteric effects on cannabinoid receptors, suggests its potential role in peripheral pathophysiological processes.},

   abstract = {The relationship between an episode of status epilepticus, the resulting hippocampal pathology, and the subsequent development of pathophysiological changes possibly relevant to human cpilepsy was explored using the experimental epilepsy model of perforant path stimulation in the rat. Granule cell hyperexcitability and decreased feedforward and feedback inhibition were evident immediately after 24 hours of intermittent perforant path stimulation and persisted relatively unchanged for more than 1 year. All of the pathophysiological changes induced by perforant path stimulation were replicated in normal animals by a subconvulsive dose of bicuculline, suggesting that the permanent “epileptiform” abnormalities produced by sustained perforant path stimulation may be due to decreased GABA‐mediated inhibition. Granule cell pathophysiology was seen only in animals that exhibited a loss of adjacent dentate hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin/neuropeptide Y‐immunoreactive neurons. GABA‐immunoreactive dentate basket cells survived despite the extensive loss of adjacent hilar neurons. However, Parvalbumin immunoreactivity, present normally in a subpopulation of GABA‐immunoreactive dentate basket cells, was absent on the stimulated side. Whether this represents decreased parvalbumin synthesis in surviving basket cells or a loss of a specific subset of inhibitory cells is unclear. Hyperexcitability and decreased paired‐pulse inhibition in response to ipsilateral perforant path stimulation were also present in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer on the previously stimulated side, despite minimal damage to CA1 pyramidal cells or interneurons. The possibility that CA1 inhibitory neurons were hypofunctional or “dormant” due to a loss of excitatory input to inhibitory cells from damaged CA3 pyramidal cells was tested by stimulating the contralateral perforant path in order to activate the same CA1 basket cells via different inputs. Contralateral stimulation evoked CA1 pyramidal cell paired‐pulse inhibition immediately in the previously stimulated hippocampus. Thus, we propose the “dormant basket cell” hypothesis, which implies that despite malfunction, inhibitory systems remain intact in “epileptic” tissue and are capable of functioning if appropriately activated.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids are crucial for the extinction of aversive memories, a process that considerably involves the amygdala. Here, we show that low-frequency stimulation of afferents in the lateral amygdala with 100 pulses at 1 Hz releases endocannabinoids postsynaptically from neurons of the basolateral amygdala of mice in vitro and thereby induces a long-term depression of inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission (LTDi) via a presynaptic mechanism. Lowering inhibitory synaptic transmission significantly increases the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents in principal neurons of the central nucleus, which is the main output site of the amygdala. LTDi involves a selective mGluR1 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 1)-mediated calcium-independent mechanism and the activation of the adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A pathway. LTDi is abolished by the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist SR141716A and cannot be evoked in CB1 receptor-deficient animals. LTDi is significantly enhanced in mice lacking the anandamide-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase. The present findings show for the first time that mGluR activation induces a retrograde endocannabinoid signaling via activation of the adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A pathway and the release of anandamide. Furthermore, the results indicate that anandamide decreases the activity of inhibitory interneurons in the amygdala. This disinhibition increases the activity of common output neurons and could provide a prerequisite for extinction by formation of new memory.},

By contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are superimposed on discrete functional domains.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) exert major control over neuronal activity by activating cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). The functionality of the eCB system is primarily ascribed to the well-documented retrograde activation of presynaptic CB1Rs. We find that action potential-driven eCB release leads to a long-lasting membrane potential hyperpolarization in hippocampal principal cells that is independent of CB1Rs. The hyperpolarization, which is specific to CA3 and CA2 pyramidal cells (PCs), depends on the activation of neuronal CB2Rs, as shown by a combined pharmacogenetic and immunohistochemical approach. Upon activation, they modulate the activity of the sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter, leading to a hyperpolarization of the neuron. CB2R activation occurred in a purely self-regulatory manner, robustly altered the input/output function of CA3 PCs, and modulated gamma oscillations in vivo. To conclude, we describe a cell type-specific plasticity mechanism in the hippocampus that provides evidence for the neuronal expression of CB2Rs and emphasizes their importance in basic neuronal transmission. The neuronal expression of CB2Rs has been a matter of long-standing debate. Stempel et al. demonstrate that CB2Rs are expressed in hippocampal principal cells and modulate neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo.},

Hilar mossy cells, in particular, are thought to show dramatic numerical reductions in pathological conditions, and one prominent theory of epileptogenesis is based on the assumption that mossy cell loss directly results in granule cell hyperexcitability. However, whether it is the disappearance of hilar mossy cells from the dentate gyrus circuitry after various insults or the subsequent synaptic-cellular alterations (e.g., reactive axonal sprouting) that lead to dentate hyperexcitability has not been rigorously tested, because of the lack of available techniques to rapidly remove specific classes of nonprincipal cells from neuronal networks. We developed a fast, cell-specific ablation technique that allowed the targeted lesioning of either mossy cells or GABAergic interneurons in horizontal as well as axial (longitudinal) slices of the hippocampus. The results demonstrate that mossy cell deletion consistently decreased the excitability of granule cells to perforant path stimulation both within and outside of the lamella where the mossy cell ablation took place. In contrast, ablation of interneurons caused the expected increase in excitability, and control aspirations of the hilar neuropil or of interneurons in the presence of GABA receptor blockers caused no alteration in granule cell excitability. These data do not support the hypothesis that loss of mossy cells from the dentate hilus after seizures or traumatic brain injury directly results in hyperexcitability.},

   abstract = {The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflects a precarious balance between neurodegenerative phenomena and reactive events of neuroplasticity. This latter aspect of AD neuropathology has received less attention than it deserves and its contribution to memory loss is therefore not well understood. To monitor neuroplastic-related events we studied the distribution of the plasticity-associated, brain growth protein GAP-43 in AD subjects and age-matched controls. In tissue from AD patients, we observed a consistent elevation of GAP-43 in a subfield of the hippocampus, stratum lacunosum moleculare. This subfield contains inputs from multiple brain regions and is known to regulate declarative memory function. Levels of potentially aberrant sprouting, as marked by elevated growth protein, were positively correlated with the severity of AD suggesting that increased expression of GAP-43 leads to a miswiring of circuits critical for memory function. Our findings suggest a mechanism, aberrant neuroplasticity, that in concert with neurodegeneration may importantly contribute to the memory loss in AD. © 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {GAP-43 is a growth-associated phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in neurons during development, axonal regeneration, and neuritic sprouting. GAP- 43 gene expression in mature neurons is probably functionally important for the structural remodeling of synapses as required for learning and establishing new memory. The widespread aberrant neuritic growth accompanied by impaired synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that abnormal GAP-43 gene expression may contribute to the cascade of neurodegeneration. In the present study, end-stage AD brains exhibited reduced neuronal expression but increased glial cell levels of GAP-43 mRNA and protein. Glial cell localization of GAP-43 gene expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization of cerebral tissue, Northern blot analysis of microdissected cerebral white matter, and independent analysis of astrocytoma cell lines and primary malignant astrocytomas. In addition, in AD, GAP-43 immunoreactivity was translocated from the cytosol to membranes of swollen neuritic (dendritic) and glial cell processes throughout cerebral cortex and white matter. Downregulated and aberrant neuronal GAP-43 gene expression appears to re fleet an important molecular lesion that precedes and progresses with the widespread synaptic disconnection and dementia in AD. At the same time, the presence of similar neuronal abnormalities in Pick's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease, and Down syndrome suggests common mechanisms in the respective cascades of neurodegeneration. Finally, the finding of aberrantly, increased glial cell GAP-43 gene expression in AD exposes a previously unrecognized neurodegenerative change that may account for the axonal loss and white matter atrophy detected early in the course of disease.},

   abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and in certain forms of learning. Recently, we found a learning-specific, time-dependent increase in [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding to membrane-associated PKC in the hippocampus of rats subjected to an inhibitory avoidance task. Here we confirm and extend this observation, describing that a one trial inhibitory avoidance learning was associated with rapid and specific increases in B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation in vitro and in PKC activity in hippocampal synaptosomal membranes. The increased phosphorylation of B-50/GAP-43 was seen at 30 rain (+35% relative to naive or shocked control groups), but not at 10 or 60 rain after training. This learning-associated increase in the phosphorylation of B-50/GAP-43 is mainly due to an increase in the activity of PKC. This is based on three different sets of data: 1) PKC activity increased by 24% in hippocampal synaptosomal membranes of rats sacrificed 30 min after training; 2) B-50/GAP-43 immunoblots revealed no changes in the amount of this protein among the different experimental groups; 3) phosphorylation assays, performed in the presence of bovine purified PKC or in the presence of the selective PKC inhibitor CGP 41231, exhibited no differences in B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation between naive and trained animals. In conclusion, these results support the contention that hippocampal PKC participates in the early neural events of memory formation of an aversively-motivated learning task.},

B-50, GAP-43, neuromodulin, pp46), yet kainic acid (KA) can induce extensive growth of granule cell axons, the mossy fibers, into the supragranular layer. Does this KA-induced growth occur in the absence of protein Fl/GAP-43? Using quantitative in situ hybridization, we found that 16-24 h after KA (10 mg/kg, s.c.) Fl/GAP-43 mRNA was in fact induced in granule cells and remained elevated above control levels for at least 20 days. The induction of Fl/GAP-43 mRNA in granule cells was blocked either by MK-801 or pentobarbital pretreatment. If pentobarbitol was given 55 min, but not 90 min, after KA, Fl/GAP-43 mRNA was also blocked. Since induction of Fl/GAP-43 occurred when pentobarbitol was given 90 min after KA, a 35 min window of activation is required, beyond the initial 55 min, for F1/GAP-43 mRNA induction. As both MK-801 and pentobarbital blocked behavioral seizures their anti-convulsant action may be important for blocking Fl/GAP-43 mRNA induction. Mossy fiber sprouting observed 30 days after KA was also blocked when either MK-801 or pentobarbital was given prior to KA. These results are consistent with the proposal that protein Fl/GAP-43 promotes axonal growth in the adult brain in an input-dependent manner, and may also be of clinical relevance to the molecular mechanisms underlying structural remodeling in epilepsy. © 1995.},

We monitored the phosphorylation state of two identified neural-specific protein kinase C (PKC) substrates (the presynaptic protein GAP-43/B-50 and postsynaptic protein RC3) after different chemical depolarisations. TEA induced a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and increased the phosphorylation of both GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 (51 and 56.1%, respectively). These effects were blocked by the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, but not by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5.

We used in situ hybridization in rat brain to determine the cellular distribution of its gene expression. Throughout the septotemporal axis of the adult hippocampus, pyramidal cells express F1/GAP-43 mRNA, but granule cells do not. To determine if F1/GAP-43 expression in granule cells ever occurs, we studied its expression in development during mossy fiber outgrowth, when expression should be maximal. Quantitation of relative hybridization levels in the hippocampus revealed a modest increase in granule cell F1/GAP-43 mRNA coincident with mossy fiber outgrowth. But even the peak hybridization in granule cells on day 16 was 75% less than in pyramidal cells. The distribution of grains was over the entire granule cell layer at day 9, but was restricted by day 20 to the inner aspect of the layer, the site of the youngest cells which are still sending out axonal processes. Cell-selective expression of F1/GAP-43 within a particular brain structure was not restricted to the hippocampus. In cerebellum, F1/GAP-43 hybridization was detected in granule cells but not Purkinje cells; in olfactory bulb, mitral cells but not internal granule cells; in habenula, cells in the lateral but not medial nucleus; in substantia nigra, pars compacta cells but not cells in pars reticulata. Neurons containing biogenic amines exhibited intense F1/GAP-43 hybridization: substantia nigra pars compacta (dopamine), the locus coeruleus (norepinephrine), and dorsal raphe (serotonin). In contrast, cholinergic neurons exhibited little (basal forebrain) or no (medial habenula) hybridization. F1/GAP-43 expression is not restricted to a specific cell type and is not correlated with axon length. High F1/GAP-43 expression is apparent in many neurons having either neuromodulatory or memory storage functions. We propose that F1/GAP-43 is important for accelerating process outgrowth and synaptic remodeling, rather than directing growth itself. © 1991.},

   abstract = {Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the biochemical pathways thought to be activated during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the brain, and long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two of the most extensively studied models of synaptic plasticity. Here we have examined changes in the in situ phosphorylation level of two major PKC substrates, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and growth-associated protein (GAP)-43/B-50, after pharmacological stimulation or induction of LTP or LTD in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. We find that direct PKC activation with phorbol esters, K+-induced depolarization, and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors increase the in situ phosphorylation of both MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50. The induction of LTP increased the in situ phosphorylation of both MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50 at 10 min following high-frequency stimulation, but only GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation remained elevated 60 min after LTP induction. Furthermore, blockade of LTP induction with the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5- phosphonopentanoic acid prevented elevations in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation but did not prevent the elevation in MARCKS phosphorylation 10 min following LTP induction. The induction of LTD resulted in a reduction in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation but did not affect MARCKS phosphorylation. Together these findings show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity elicits PKC- mediated phosphorylation of substrate proteins in a highly selective and coordinated manner and demonstrate the compartmentalization of PKC-substrate interactions.},

During this period, synaptic terminals appear fully mature, morphologically and physiologically. We show here, however, that synaptic terminals during this period are distinguished by their simultaneous accumulation of multiple growth-associated proteins at levels characteristic of axonal growth cones, and proteins involved in synaptic transmitter release at levels characteristic of adult synapses. We show further that newly formed synapses undergo a switch in the dynamic S- palmitoylation of proteins early in the critical period, which includes a large and specific decrease in the palmitoylation of GAP-43 and other major substrates characteristic of growth cones. Previous studies have shown that a similar reduction in ongoing palmitoylation of growth cone proteins is sufficient to stop advancing axons in vitro, suggesting that a developmental switch in protein S-palmitoylation serves to disengage the molecular machinery for axon extension in the absence of local triggers for remodeling during the critical period. Only much later does a decline in the availability of major growth cone components mark the molecular maturation of cortical synapses at the close of the critical period.},

The increase in protein F1 phosphorylation was related to LTE rather than simple activation of perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses. This is the first report of a change in brain protein phosphorylation accompanying synaptic enhancement lasting days. The extent of growth of LTE over the three days following stimulation was directly related (r = +0.66, P < 0.05) to protein F1 phosphorylation. Among the phosphorylation. Among the phosphoproteins studied this relationship between LTE and phosphorylation was selective for protein F1. This suggests that protein F1 may regulate growth of synaptic plasticity for at least a three day period. The mechanism for the LTE-related increase in protein F1 phosphorylation has not been established. However, recent evidence from this laboratory indicates: (1) that protein F1 is phosphorylated by the calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C; and (2) that kinase C is activated 1 h after LTE. Therefore, the increase in protein F1 phosphorylation following LTE may result from long term activation of protein C kinase. © 1985.},

Protein F1 phosphorylation was directly related to the magnitude and persistence of potentiation. No other phosphoprotein studied exhibited a relationship with synaptic enhancement. Low-frequency, non-potentiating stimulation did not increase protein F1 phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of F1 was not elevated when high-frequency stimulation did not produce potentiation. We also confirmed our earlier demonstration of a similar pattern of results 5 min after LTP. In related work we have previously observed: (1) that protein F1 is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC); (2) that membrane PKC activity was increased by translocation from the cytosol following LTP; and (3) that membrane PKC activity was directly related to the persistence of enhancement. We therefore predicted in the present study that protein F1 phosphorylation in a dorsal hippocampal membrane fraction would be related to LTP. Hippocampal membrane protein F1 was found to be directly related to both the magnitude and persistence of response enhancement. Thus the molecular events leading to prolonged potentiation may involve increased PKC/protein F1 association.

Since PKC isozymes are differentially expressed in brain and the expression of F1/GAP-43 and MARCKS mRNAs are differentially regulated by PKC through posttranslational mechanisms, the present study examined the relative distribution of both mRNAs in the adult rat brain by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. MARCKS hybridization was most pronounced in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex (layer II), medial habenular nucleus, subregions of the amygdala, specific hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampal granule cells, neocortex, and cerebellar cortex, intermediate in the superior colliculus, hippocampal CA1, and certain brainstem nuclei including the locus coeruleus, and low-absent in regions of the caudate-putamen, geniculate nuclei, thalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal and hilar neurons. Consistent with previous reports, prominent F1/GAP-43 hybridization was observed in neocortex, medial geniculate, piriform cortex (layer II), substantia nigra pars compacta, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and cerebellar granule cells, intermediate in regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, and low-absent in regions of the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, medial habenular nucleus, hippocampal granule cells, and superior colliculus. Overall, F1/GAP-43 was highly expressed in a greater number of regions compared to MARCKS and, in a number of regions, including the hippocampus, habenular complex, ventral tegmentum, geniculate, and certain brain stem nuclei, a striking inverse pattern of expression was observed. These results indicate that MARCKS gene expression, like that of F1/GAP-43, remains elevated in select regions of the adult rat brain which are associated with a high degree of retained plasticity. The potential role of PKC in the regulation of MARCKS and F1/GAP-43 gene expression in brain is assessed.},

Such synthesis appears to correlate with axonal growth during maturation and regrowth after axotomy. In most adult neurons, the sharp decline in GAP‐43 gene expression implies a reduced capacity for axonal growth. Neurons capable of extending axonal knobs in the absence of injury may indicate a “plasticity” underlying dynamic processes of interaction between neurons and their synaptic targets. Antisense and sense (control) riboprobes were used on serial sections in the three principal axes, and the magnitude of hybridization signal was examined to determine regional patterns. GAP‐43 mRNA levels are pronounced in diverse neuronal groups including the locus coeruleus, raphé nn., dopaminergic nigral and ventral tegmental nn., mitral cells, hippocampal CA3, inferior olivary n., vagal motor n. and other parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, select thalamic midline and intralaminar nn., several specific nn. of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain, the granular layer of cerebellar cortex, the infragranular neocortex, and the granular olfactory paleocortex; there is substantial range in the magnitude of expression. Regions revealing minimal signal include most thalamic sensory relay nuclei, the granule neurons of the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus, and the caudate and putamen. Possible concomitants of GAP‐43 expression include regulation of ion flux and neurotrans‐mitter release. Those neurons with long, extensively dispersed and numerous synaptic connections display the strongest signals and may possess the greatest propensity for continuous growth and turnover of their axon terminals, in contrast to short‐axon and specific projection neurons exhibiting minimal levels.

   abstract = {There is an urgent need for animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to understand the underlying pathology and facilitate development and testing of new treatments. The synaptic growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) has recently been identified as an autism candidate gene of interest. Our previous studies show many brain abnormalities in mice lacking one allele for GAP43 [GAP43 (+/-)] that are consistent with the disordered connectivity theory of ASD. Thus, we hypothesized that GAP43 (+/-) mice would show at least some autistic-like behaviors. We found that GAP43 (+/-) mice, relative to wild-type (+/+) littermates, displayed resistance to change, consistent with one of the diagnostic criteria for ASD. GAP43 (+/-) mice also displayed stress-induced behavioral withdrawal and anxiety, as seen in many autistic individuals. In addition, both GAP43 (+/-) mice and (+/+) littermates showed low social approach and lack of preference for social novelty, consistent with another diagnostic criterion for ASD. This low sociability is likely because of the mixed C57BL/6J 129S3/SvImJ background. We conclude that GAP43 deficiency leads to the development of a subset of autistic-like behaviors. As these behaviors occur in a mouse that displays disordered connectivity, we propose that future anatomical and functional studies in this mouse may help uncover underlying mechanisms for these specific behaviors. Strain-specific low sociability may be advantageous in these studies, creating a more autistic-like environment for study of the GAP43-mediated deficits of resistance to change and vulnerability to stress. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Sympathetic neurons regenerating in culture were studied in order to gain further insight into the intracellular distribution and phosphorylation of GAP-43, a protein that has been suggested to have a role in axonal outgrowth and neuronal plasticity (Willard et al., 1987). Superior cervical ganglion neurons from embryonic rats were highly reactive with a polyclonal antibody against the growth-associated protein GAP-43 soon after they were placed in culture on a laminin substrate. As these neurons extended neurites, the distribution of GAP-43 reactivity changed. The cell body became progressively less reactive, whereas the growth cone at the tip of the growing neurite reacted strongly. The pattern of immunofluorescence was punctate both in the growth cone and the adjacent neurite, but appeared more diffusely distributed in the cell body. The antibody reacted only with cells that had been subjected to treatment that permeabilized the plasma membrane. When antibody was supplied in the medium of growing neurons, it neither bound to the cells nor altered normal neurite initiation or elongation. Of the different types of cells in these cultures, the antibody reacted only with neurons; it did not react with Schwann cells or fibroblasts. The stimulation of protein kinase in these cultures resulted in a 7-fold stimulation of the phosphorylation of a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility to GAP-43. These observations demonstrate that GAP-43 is neuron-specific, is present throughout the neuron but at higher levels in the growth cone, and is a major substrate of protein kinase C. The high concentration of GAP-43 in the growth cones may necessitate its increased synthesis in neurons with elongating axons. Its location and phosphorylation by kinase C suggest that it could perform a function in the growth cone that is modulated by extracellular signals, such as those used in pathfinding or in the control of axonal elongation.},

   abstract = {Neuromodulin (also called GAP43, B50, F1, pp46), a neural-specific calmodulin binding protein, is a major protein kinase C substrate found in developing and regerating neurons. Here, we report the immunocytochemical characterization of neuromodulin in cultured 0-2A bipotential glial precursor cells obtained from newborn rat brain. Neuromodulin is also present in oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes (stellate-shaped astrocytes), which are both derived from the bipotential glial 0-2A progenitor cells, but is absent of type 1 astrocytes (flat protoplasmic astrocytes). These results support the hypothesis of a common cell lineage for neurons and bipotential 0-2A progenitor cells and suggest that neuromodulin plays a more general role in plasticity during development of the central nervous system. The expression of neuromodulin in secondary cultures of newborn rat oligodendrocytes and its absence in type 1 astrocytes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of isolated total RNA from these different types of cells using a cDNA probe for the neuromodulin mRNA and by Western blot analysis of the cells extracts using polyclonal antibodies against neuromodulin. The properties of the neuromodulin protein is cultured oligodendrocytes and neuronal cells have been compared. Although neuromodulin in oligodendrocytes is soluble in 2.5% perchloric acid like the neuronal counterpart it migrates esentially as a single protein spot on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis whereas the neuronal antigen can be resolved into at least three distinct protein spots. To obtain precise alignments of the different neuromodulin spots from these two cell types, oligodendrocyte and neuronal cell extracts were mixed together and run on the same two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system. Oligodendroglial neuromodulin migrates with a pI identical to the basic forms of the neuronal protein in isoelectric focusing gel. However, the glial neuromodulin shows a slightly lower mobility in the second dimensional lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE than its neuronal counterpart. As measured by 32Pi incorporation, neuromodulin phosphorylation in oligodendrocytes is drmatically increased after short-term phorbol ester treatments, which activate protein kinase C, and is totally inhibited by long-term phorbol ester treatments, which downregulates protein kinase C, thus confirming its probabe specific in vivo phosphorylation by protein kinase C. In primary cultures of neuronal cells, two of the three neuromodulin spots were observed to be phosphorylated with an apparent preferential phosphorylation of the more acid forms.},

   abstract = {There is now conclusive evidence for widespread ongoing structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons and axon side-branches in the adult brain. The plasticity complements that of postsynaptic spines, but axonal plasticity samples larger volumes of neuropil, and has a larger impact on circuit remodeling. Axons from distinct neurons exhibit unique ratios of stable (t1/2 > 9 months) and dynamic (t1/2 5-20 days) boutons, which persist as spatially intermingled subgroups along terminal arbors. In addition, phases of side-branch dynamics mediate larger scale remodeling guided by synaptogenesis. The plasticity is most pronounced during critical periods; its patterns and outcome are controlled by Hebbian mechanisms and intrinsic neuronal factors. Novel experience, skill learning, life-style, and age can persistently modify local circuit structure through axonal structural plasticity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

GAP-43 was expressed at the highest level in the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NDR), nucleus centralis superior (NCS), substantia nigra compacta (SNc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus (LC). An intermediate level of signal was detected over the periaqueductal gray, superior colliculi, and thalamic region, and no significant signal was detected in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and red nucleus. The hybridization signals of GAP-43 mRNA and trypotophan hydroxylase mRNA completely overlapped in the NDR and NCS, and signals for GAP-43 mRNA and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA overlapped in the SNc, VTA, and LC. The disappearance of the hybridization signal for GAP-43 mRNA after intracerebroventricular injections of the neurotoxins 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) indicated that high levels of GAP-43 are synthesized in the serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei and in the catecholaminergic neurons of the SNc, VTA, and LC. In light of the role of GAP-43 in axonal outgrowth, modulation of signal transduction, and release of different neurotransmitters in the adult CNS, this phosphoprotein might be involved in the functional plasticity and synaptic transmission of monoaminergic neurons.},

We measured MRNA levels of growth-associated protein (GAP-43), a peptide linked to the modifiability of neuronal connections, in post-mortem brain tissue from two cohorts of patients with schizophrenia and controls. Using the Rnase protection assay (RPA), we found a significant reduction in GAP-43 MRNA in the DLPFC, but not in the hippocampus, of patients with schizophrenia. With in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH), performed on a separate cohort, we confirmed the reduction of GAP-43 MRNA in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia. We detected reduced GAP-43 MRNA per neuron in layers III, V and VI of patients with schizophrenia compared with normal controls and patients with bipolar disorder. Thus, glutamate neurons in DLPFC of schizophrenic patients may synthesize less GAP-43, which could reflect fewer and/or less modifiable connections than those in normal human brain, and which may be consistent with the deficits of prefrontal cortical function that characterize schizophrenia.},

By homologous recombination, we generated mice lacking GAP-43. The mice die in the early postnatal period. GAP-43-deficient retinal axons remain trapped in the chiasm for 6 days, unable to navigate past this midline decision point. Over the subsequent weeks of life, most GAP-43-deficient axons do enter the appropriate tracts, and the adult CNS is grossly normal. There is no evidence for interference with nerve growth rate, and cultured neurons extend neurites and growth cones in a fashion indistinguishable from controls. Thus, the GAP-43 protein is not essential for axonal outgrowth or growth cone formation per se, but is required at certain decision points, such as the optic chiasm. This is compatible with the hypothesis that GAP-43 serves to amplify pathfinding signals from the growth cone. © 1995.},

   abstract = {Bipolar disorder is one of the most severely debilitating of all medical illnesses. For a large number of patients, outcomes are quite poor. The illness results in tremendous suffering for patients and their families and commonly impairs functioning and workplace productivity. Risks of increased morbidity and mortality, unfortunately, are frequent occurrences as well.Until recently, little has been known about the specific molecular and cellular underpinnings of bipolar disorder. Such knowledge is crucial for the prospect of developing specific targeted therapies that are more effective and that have a more rapid onset of action than currently available treatments. Exciting recent data suggest that regulation of certain signalling pathways may be involved in the aetiology of bipolar disorder and that these pathways may be profitably targeted to treat the disorder. In particular, mania is associated with overactive protein kinase C (PKC) intracellular signalling, and recent genome-wide association studies of bipolar disorder have implicated an enzyme that reduces the activation of PKC. Importantly, the current mainstays in the treatment of mania, lithium (a monovalent cation) and valproate (a small fatty acid) indirectly inhibit PKC. In addition, recent clinical studies with the relatively selective PKC inhibitor tamoxifen add support to the relevance of the PKC target in bipolar disorder.Overall, a growing body of work both on a preclinical and clinical level indicates that PKC signalling may play an important role in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder. The development of CNS-penetrant PKC inhibitors may have considerable benefit for this devastating illness. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.},

   abstract = {Growth cones are powerful amplifiers for signals from the microenvironment. Their collapse can be triggered by cell surface components of myelin and brain membranes, as well as by soluble ligands, including neurotransmitters. GAP-43 is a protein concentrated on the inner surface of the growth cone membrane. Assayed in isolation, it interacts with the heterotrimeric protein, G(o), and in oocytes it amplifies the effects of ligand-triggered G protein activation. We wished to examine whether GAP-43 serves to amplify signals at the growth cone. The G(o) stimulating region of GAP-43 is encoded in the 10 amino acids (MLCCMRRTKQ) of the first exon. We examined the effect of this peptide upon chick dorsal root ganglion growth cone collapse and neurite retraction triggered by brain membranes or myelin, as well as by serotonin. We find that application of the GAP-43 1-10 peptide amplifies the effects of all three ligands. The amplification is greater when GAP-43 1-10 is injected intracellularly. Peptides with amino acid substitutions for the two cysteine residues manifest parallel changes in growth cone collapse and G(o) stimulation. In particular, tyrosine or methionine substitutions cause the peptide to inhibit G(o) and to block induced growth cone collapse. The GAP-43 peptides therefore regulate the sensitivity of growth cones to extrinsic signals. The modified peptides serve as a starting point for the design of reagents to enhance CNS regeneration.},

   abstract = {Interstitial branches arise from the axon shaft, sometimes at great distances behind the primary growth cone. After a waiting period that can last for days after extension of the primary growth cone past the target, branches elongate toward their targets. Delayed interstitial branching is an important but little understood mechanism for target innervation in the developing CNS of vertebrates. One possible mechanism of collateral branch formation is that the axon shaft responds to target-derived signals independent of the primary growth cone. Another possibility is that the primary growth cone recognizes the target and demarcates specific regions of the axon for future branching. To address whether behaviors of the primary growth cone and development of interstitial branches are related, we performed high-resolution time-lapse imaging on dissociated sensorimotor cortical neurons that branch interstitially in vivo. Imaging of entire cortical neurons for periods of days revealed that the primary growth cone pauses in regions in which axon branches later develop. Pausing behaviors involve repeated cycles of collapse, retraction, and extension during which growth cones enlarge and reorganize. Remnants of reorganized growth cones are left behind on the axon shaft as active filopodial or lamellar protrusions, and axon branches subsequently emerge from these active regions of the axon shaft. In this study we propose a new model to account for target innervation in vivo by interstitial branching. Our model suggests that delayed interstitial branching results directly from target recognition by the primary growth cone.},

This suggests a hitherto nonelucidated role of this protein in neurite outgrowth. Comparable high levels of B-50 arise in the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line during neurite formation. To get insight in the putative growth-associated function of B-50, we compared its ultrastructural localization in naive PC12 cells with its distribution in nerve growth factor (NGF)- of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-treated PC12 cells. B-50 immunogold labeling of cryosections of untreated PC12 cells is mainly associated with lysosomal structures, including multivesicular bodies, secondary lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus. The plasma membrane is virtually devoid of label. However, after 48-h NGF treatment of the cells, B-50 immunoreactivity is most pronounced on the plasma membrane. Highest B-50 immunoreactivity is observed on plasma membranes surrounding sprouting microvilli, lamellipodia, and filopodia. Outgrowing neurites are scattered with B-50 labeling, which is partially associated with chromaffin granules. In NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, B-50 immunoreactivity is, as in untreated cells, also associated with organelles of the lysosomal family and Golgi stacks. B-50 distribution in dbcAMP-differentiated cells closely resembles that in NGF-treated cells. The altered distribution of B-50 immunoreactivity induced by differentiating agents indicates a shift of the B-50 protein towards the plasma membrane. This translocation accompanies the acquisition of neuronal features of PC12 cells and points to a neurite growth-associated role for B-50, performed at the plasma membrane at the site of protrusion.},

   abstract = {Much circumstantial evidence that GAP-43 is involved in neuronal growth cone function has accumulated over the last ten years. The expression of the protein is closely correlated both temporally and spatially with periods of axonal outgrowth, and the protein is highly concentrated in the growth cone membrane. There is direct evidence that overexpression of the protein can alter cell shape. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms whereby GAP-43 could exert these actions. One important requirement for GAP-43 function is its localization to appropriate regions of the cell. The ability of this hydrophilic protein to associate with membrane fractions is determined by a short 10 amino acid stretch of the amino terminus of the protein, which contains two cysteine residues subject to palmitoylation. Whether this region can direct growth cone targeting in neurons is not yet clear. Once appropriately localized, GAP-43 may modulate complex cellular properties such as growth cone motility, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release. One possible molecular mechanism for these cellular changes in GAP-43 regulation of the GTP-binding protein, G(o). The observation that the growth cone membrane contains extremely high concentrations of G(o) led us to investigate the interaction of G(o) and GAP-43. There is evidence that G protein-mediated transduction systems can control the same cellular functions thought to be altered by GAP-43: growth cone motility, neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Purified GAP-43 does stimulate guanine nucleotide binding to G(o). Its action in stimulating GDP release is quite similar to that of G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

As a model for its neuronal effects, GAP-43 protein injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes strongly augments the calcium-sensitive chloride current evoked by the G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. We have now examined a series of GAP-43 mutants in this system and determined those regions of GAP-43 required for this increase in current flux. As expected, palmitoylation inhibits signal amplification in oocytes by blocking G protein activation. Unexpectedly, a second domain of GAP-43 (residues 35-50) containing a protein kinase C phosphorylation site at residue 41 is also necessary for augmentation of G protein-coupled signals in oocytes. This region is not required for activation of isolated Go but is necessary for GAP-43 binding to isolated calmodulin and to isolated protein kinase C. Substitution of Asp for Ser41 inactivates GAP-43 as a signal facilitator in oocytes. This mutation blocks GAP-43 binding to both protein kinase C and calmodulin. Thus, GAP-43 regulates an oocyte signaling cascade via coordinated, simultaneous G protein activation and interaction with either calmodulin or protein kinase C.},

Here we show that the neurite outgrowth stimulated by NCAM-mediated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor activation in cerebellar granule cells is associated with increased GAP-43 phosphorylation on serine-41. In contrast neither NCAM nor FGF was able to stimulate neurite outgrowth in similar neurons from mice in which the GAP-43 gene had been deleted by homologous recombination. Integrin-mediated neurite outgrowth was unaffected by GAP-43 deletion. Both neurite outgrowth and rapid phosphorylation of GAP-43 in isolated growth cones required the first three Ig domains of a NCAM-Fc chimera and were stimulated maximally at 5 μg/ml (~50 nM). Likewise, GAP-43 phosphorylation in isolated growth cones also was stimulated by an L1-Fc chimera. Both neurite outgrowth and NCAM- stimulated GAP-43 phosphorylation were inhibited by antibodies to the FGF receptor and a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (RHC80267) that blocks the production of arachidonic acid in response to activation of the FGF receptor. Direct activation of the FGF receptor and the arachidonic acid cascade with either basic FGF or melittin also resulted in increased GAP-43 phosphorylation. These data suggest that the stimulation of neurite outgrowth by NCAM requires GAP-43 function and that GAP-43 phosphorylation in isolated growth cones occurs via an FGF receptor-dependent increase in arachidonic acid.},

In the present study, to clarify the functional significance of GAP‐43 for neurite maintenance and acetylcholine (ACh) release, we prepared NG‐G11 cells by transfection of GAP‐43 cDNA into NG108‐15 cells. NG‐G11 cells expressed GAP‐43 mRNA at levels approximately twice that in nontransfected or vector‐transfected cells under control conditions and after treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (diBu‐cAMP) or 12‐O‐tetradecanoylphorbol 13‐acetate (TPA) plus diBu‐cAMP. Neurite outgrowth after addition of diBu‐cAMP was greater in NG‐G11 than in control cells. In NG‐G11 cells, neurites elongated by treatment with diBu‐cAMP for 72 h were maintained after removal of the drug. Treatment with TPA plus diBu‐cAMP for 24 h induced neurite outgrowth in NG‐G11 cells, although control cells required 72 h. Depolarization by 50 mM KCI induced ACh release in both NG‐G11 and control cells treated with diBu‐cAMP or TPA/diBu‐cAMP. Although removal of the drugs following diBu‐cAMP treatment reversed ACh release to nontreated levels in control cells, a high‐K+‐induced level of ACh release remained in NG‐G11 cells after removal of diBu‐cAMP. ACh release induced by TPA plus diBu‐cAMP for 24 h was further enhanced after removal of the drugs in NG‐G11 cells, but it was not seen in control cells. These results suggest that levels of GAP‐43 mRNA are correlated with neurite maintenance and the level of ACh release. Thus, GAP‐43 may be involved in neuronal differentiation in NG108‐15 cells.

To evaluate the importance of the PKC phosphorylation site and calmodulin‐binding domain of B‐50 in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we introduced two monoclonal antibodies to B‐50 into streptolysin O‐permeated synaptosomes isolated from rat cerebral cortex. NM2 antibodies directed to the N‐terminal residues 39–43 of rat B‐50 dose‐dependently inhibited Ca2+‐induced radiolabeled and endogenous noradrenaline release from permeated synaptosomes. NM6 C‐terminal‐directed (residues 132–213) anti‐B‐50 antibodies were without effect in the same dose range. NM2 inhibited PKC‐mediated B‐50 phosphorylation at Ser41 in synaptosomal plasma membranes and permeated synaptosomes, inhibited 32P‐B‐50 dephosphorylation by endogenous synaptosomal phosphatases, and inhibited the binding of calmodulin to synaptosomal B‐50 in the absence of Ca2+. Similar concentrations of NM6 did not affect B‐50 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation or B‐50/calmodulin binding. We conclude that the N‐terminal residues 39–43 of the rat B‐50 protein play an important role in the process of Ca2+‐induced noradrenaline release, presumably by serving as a local calmodulin store that is regulated in a Ca2+‐ and phosphorylation‐dependent fashion.

Immunoblot analysis of proteins from AS1 and AS2 cells indicated that the level of GAP‐43 in these cell lines was reduced. In the presence of extracellular calcium, a depolarizing concentration of K+ (56 mM) evoked dopamine release from control cells, but not from AS1 and AS2 cells. Similarly, the calcium ionophore A23187 evoked dopamine release from control cells, but was ineffective in stimulating dopamine release from AS1 and AS2 cells. The antisense transfectants, as well as the control cells, contained appreciable quantities of dopamine and secretory granules with a normal appearance. Because the expression of antisense GAP‐43 RNA in PC12 cells leads to a decrease in GAP‐43 expression and to the loss of evoked dopamine release, these results provide evidence of a role for GAP‐43 in calcium‐dependent neurotransmitter release.

We find that GAP-43, when microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, increases the oocyte response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists by 10- to 100- fold. Higher levels of GAP-43 cause a transient current flow, even without receptor stimulation. The GAP-43-induced current, like receptor-stimulated currents, is mediated by a calcium-activated chloride channel and can be desensitized by injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This suggests that neuronal GAP-43 may serve as an intracellular signal to greatly enhance the sensitivity of G protein-coupled receptor transduction.},

   abstract = {Cerebellar neurons, cultured on monolayers of 3T3 fibroblasts or on a polylysine/laminin-coated substratum, responded to recombinant basic FGF by extending longer neurites. The response was biphasic reaching a maximum at 5 ng/ml FGF, but desensitising at 100-200 ng/ml FGF. The response to FGF could be inhibited by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (the erbstatin analogue), by a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (RHC-80267) and by a combination of N- and L-type calcium channel antagonists or other agents that negate the effects of calcium influx into neurons. The response to FGF could be fully mimicked by arachidonic acid added directly to the cultures, or generated via activation of phospholipase A2 with melittin. The response to melittin, but not to FGF or arachidonic acid, was inhibited by 4-bromophenacyl bromide, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. The response to arachidonic acid was also biphasic and high concentrations of this agent could cross-desensitise the FGF response and vice versa. The response to arachidonic acid could be fully inhibited by the agents that block or negate the effects of calcium influx into neurons, but was not inhibited by the tyrosine kinase or diacylglycerol lipase inhibitors. These data suggest that FGF stimulates neurite outgrowth by activating a cascade that involves activation of phospholipase Cγ to produce diacylglycerol, conversion of diacylglycerol to arachidonic acid by diacylglycerol lipase and the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels by arachidonic acid.},

   abstract = {The neuronal growth cone plays a crucial role in forming the complex brain architecture achieved during development, and similar nerve terminal mechanisms may operate to modify synaptic structure during adulthood. The growth cone leads the elongating axon towards appropriate synaptic targets by altering motility in response to a variety of extracellular signals. Independently of extrinsic clues, neurons mainfest intrinsic control of their growth and form (Banker and Cowan, 1979). Hence, there must be intracellular proteins which control nerve cell shape, so-called 'plasticity' or 'growth' genes. GAP-43 may be such a molecule (Skene and Willard, 1981; Benowitz and Lewis, 1983). For example, GAP-43 is localized to the growth cone membrane (Meiri et al. 1986; Skene et al. 1986) and can enhance filopodial formation even in non-neuronal cells (Zuber et al. 1989a). It includes a small region at the amino terminus for membrane association and perhaps growth cone targeting (Zuber et al 1989b, Liu et al. 1991). We have found that G(o), a member of the G protein family that links receptors and second messengers, is the major non-cytoskeletal protein in the growth cone membrane (Strittmatter et al. 1990). Double staining immunohistochemistry for GAP-43 and G(o) shows that the distributions of the two proteins are quite similar. Purified GAP-43 regulates the activity of purified G(o) (Strittmatter et al. 1990), a surprising observation since GAP-43 is an intracellular protein. We have compared the mechanism of GAP-43 activation of G(o) with that of G protein-linked receptors. GAP-43 resembles receptor activation in that both serve primarily to increase the rate of dissociation of bound GDP, with consequent increase in GTPγS binding and GTPase activity. Neither affects the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP by G(o). They differ, however, in that pertussis toxin blocks interaction of the receptor with G(o), but not that of GAP-43. Furthermore, whereas GAP-43 activates both isolated α(o) subunits and αβγ trimers, receptors require the presence of the βγ subunits. Thus like receptors, GAP-43 is a guanine nucleotide release protein, but of a novel class. The interactions between G(o) and GAP-43 suggest that G(o) plays a pivotal role in growth cone function, coordinating the effects of both extracellular signals and intracellular growth proteins.},

   abstract = {Neuronal protein GAP-43 performs multiple functions in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity and regulation of neuronal death and survival. However, the molecular mechanisms of its action in these processes are poorly understood. We have shown that in axon terminals GAP-43 is a substrate for calcium-activated cysteine protease m-calpain, which participates in repulsion of axonal growth cones and induction of neuronal death. In pre-synaptic terminals in vivo, in synaptosomes, and in vitro, m-calpain cleaved GAP-43 in a small region near Ser41, on either side of this residue. In contrast, μ-calpain cleaved GAP-43 in vitro at several other sites, besides Ser41. Phosphorylation of Ser41 by protein kinase C or GAP-43 binding to calmodulin strongly suppressed GAP-43 proteolysis by m-calpain. A GAP-43 fragment, lacking about forty N-terminal residues (named GAP-43-3), was produced by m-calpain-mediated cleavage of GAP-43 and inhibited m-calpain, but not μ-calpain. This fragment prevented complete cleavage of intact GAP-43 by m-calpain as a negative feedback. GAP-43-3 also blocked m-calpain activity against casein, a model calpain substrate. This implies that GAP-43-3, which is present in axon terminals in high amount, can play important role in regulation of m-calpain activity in neurons. We suggest that GAP-43-3 and another (N-terminal) GAP-43 fragment produced by m-calpain participate in modulation of neuronal response to repulsive and apoptotic signals. © 2007 The Authors.},

The 43 kDa growth-associated protein GAP-43 is a nerve-specific protein that is predominantly localized in the axonal growth cones and presynaptic terminal membrane. In the present study we have examined a possible interaction of GAP-43 with components involved in the exocytosis. GAP-43 was found to interact with syntaxin, SNAP-25 and VAMP in rat brain tissues and nerve growth factor-dependently differentiated PC12 cells, but not in undifferentiated PC12 cells. GAP-43 also interacted with synaptotagmin and calmodulin. These interactions of GAP-43 could be detected only when chemical cross-linking of proteins was performed before they were solubilized from the membranes with detergents, in contrast with the interaction of the synaptic core complex, which was detected without cross-linking. Experiments in vitro showed that the interaction of GAP-43 with these proteins occurred Ca2+-dependently; its maximum binding with the core complex was observed at 100 μM Ca2+, whereas that of syntaxin with synaptotagmin was at 200 μM Ca2+. These values of Ca2+ concentration are close to that required for the Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitters. Furthermore we observed that the interaction in vitro of GAP-43 with the synaptic core complex was coupled with protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of GAP-43. Taken together, our results suggest a novel function of GAP-43 that is involved in the Ca2+-dependent fusion of synaptic vesicles.},

Inspection of endogenous phosphorylation patterns of the particulate as well as the cytosolic subcellular fractions from a variety of peripheral organs failed to demonstrate phosphorylation of a molecular weight 48,000 protein. Only in the particulate fractions from brain tissue was there endogenous phosphorylation of the B‐50 protein. Two‐dimensional analysis (isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and an immunochemical detection method employing an anti‐B‐50 antiserum revealed the presence of B‐50 in particulate material from brain, but not in that of other tissues. Therefore the data were interpreted as pointing to the localization of B‐50 in nervous tissue. In addition, the regional distribution of endogenous B‐50 phosphorylation was studied using synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) obtained from individual rat brain regions. The highest value was found in SPM of septal origin, the lowest in SPM from the medulla spinalis. The relationship of the high value for B‐50 phosphorylation in the septum to the sensitivity of that brain area to ACTH1–24 is discussed. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Monospecific polyclonal affinity-purified B-50 antibodies were used to document the ultrastructural distribution of B-50 in the hippocampus of 90-day-old (P90) and 1-day-old (P1) rats. Double-labelling immunoprocedures were performed to compare the localization of B-50 and synaptophysin (p38), a protein specific for synaptic vesicles. By immunofluorescence light microscopy B-50 and p38 were similarly distributed in the CA1 neuropil of P90 rats. In contrast, in P1 rats B-50 was more widely distributed than p38. By electron microscopy of P90 rat hippocampus, B-50 was located at the plasma membranes of axon shafts and of p38-immunoreactive axon terminals. Some B-50 was found in the cytosol of axon terminals. B-50 was absent at the plasma membranes of apical dendrites and of pyramidal cells. In the P1 rat hippocampus, B-50 was detected at the plasma membrane of growth cones, axon terminals and axon shafts, but not in their cytosol. The plasma membranes of pyramidal cell bodies and their processes extending into the stratum radiatum were without B-50. B-50-immunoreactive organelles of the lysosomal family were found in the cytosol of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus of P1 and P90 rats. This ultrastructural study shows that during development of the stratum radiatum in the hippocampal field CA1, the localization of B-50 persists at the plasma membrane of axons and axon terminals in P1 and P90 rats. This localization of B-50 is consistent with the suggestion that B-50 acts as a regulator of neurotransmitter release and intracellular messengers. © 1990 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

   abstract = {Although neuronal axons and dendrites with their associated filopodia and spines exhibit a profound cell polarity, the mechanism by which they develop is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that specific palmitoylated protein motifs, characterized by two adjacent cysteines and nearby basic residues, are sufficient to induce filopodial extensions in heterologous cells and to increase the number of filopodia and the branching of dendrites and axons in neurons. Such motifs are present at the N-terminus of GAP-43 and the C-terminus of paralemmin, two neuronal proteins implicated in cytoskeletal organization and filopodial outgrowth. Filopodia induction is blocked by mutations of the palmitoylated sites or by treatment with 2-bromopalmitate, an agent that inhibits protein palmitoylation. Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively active form of ARF6, a GTPase that regulates membrane cycling and dendritic branching reversed the effects of the acylated protein motifs. Filopodia induction by the specific palmitoylated motifs was also reduced upon overexpression of a dominant negative form of the GTPase cdc42. These results demonstrate that select dually lipidated protein motifs trigger changes in the development and growth of neuronal processes.},

Despite the progress that has been made in identifying and characterizing palmitoyltransferases (PATs), much less is known about the thioesterases involved in protein deacylation. In this work, we investigated the deacylation of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), a dually acylated rotein at cysteine residues 3 and 4. Using fluorescent fusion constructs, we measured in vivo the rate of deacylation of GAP-43 and its single acylated mutants in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 and human HeLa cells. Biochemical and live cell imaging experiments demonstrated that single acylated mutants were completely deacylated with similar kinetic in both cell types. By RT-PCR we observed that acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT-1), the only bona fide thioesterase shown to mediate deacylation in vivo, is expressed in HeLa cells, but not in CHO-K1 cells. However, APT-1 overexpression neither increased the deacylation rate of single acylated GAP-43 nor affected the steady-state subcellular distribution of dually acylated GAP-43 both in CHO-K1 and HeLa cells, indicating that GAP-43 deacylation is not mediated by APT-1. Accordingly, we performed a bioinformatic search to identify putative candidates with acyl-protein thioesterase activity. Among several candidates, we found that APT-2 is expressed both in CHO-K1 and HeLa cells and its overexpression increased the deacylation rate of single acylated GAP-43 and affected the steady-state localization of diacylated GAP-43 and H-Ras. Thus, the results demonstrate that APT-2 is the protein thioesterase involved in the acylation/deacylation cycle operating in GAP-43 subcellular distribution. © 2010 Tomatis et al.},

This E-box is conserved between the rat and human GAP-43 promoter sequences in terms of flanking sequence, core sequence (CAGTTG), and position. We found that endogenous E-box-binding proteins present in neuronal N18 cells recognize the E1 E-box and activate the GAP-43 promoter. The transcriptional activity of the GAP-43 promoter was repressed not only by the negative regulator Id2 protein, but also by two class A basic helix-loop-helix proteins, E12 and ME1a. In vitro analyses showed that both ME1a and E12 bind to the E1 E-box as homodimers. By Northern analyses, we established an inverse correlation between the level of E12 and ME1a mRNAs and GAP-43 mRNA in various neuronal cell lines as well as in ME1a- overexpressing PC12 cells. Therefore, we have identified a cis-acting element, the E1 E-box, located in the GAP-43 promoter region that modulates either positively or negatively the expression of the GAP-43 gene depending on which E-box-binding proteins occupy this site. Together, these data indicate that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors regulate the expression of the GAP-43 gene and that the class A ME1a and E12 proteins act as down-regulators of GAP-43 expression.},

Phosphorylation was detected at rhodopsin C-terminal tail residues T336 and S338. These two phospho-residues, together with E341, form an extensive network of electrostatic interactions with three positively charged pockets in arrestin in a mode that resembles binding of the phosphorylated vasopressin-2 receptor tail to β-arrestin-1. Based on these observations, we derived and validated a set of phosphorylation codes that serve as a common mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of arrestins by GPCRs.},

   abstract = {Proper sorting of exocytosed synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins into individual SVs during endocytosis is of the utmost importance for the fidelity of subsequent neurotransmission. Recent studies suggest that each SV protein is sorted into individual SVs by its own dedicated adaptors as well as by association between SV proteins. The SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), an ortholog of Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only (FCHo) proteins, contains a μ-homology domain (μHD) and binds AP-2 and Eps15, thus functioning as an endocytic regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Its longest isoform SGIP1α is predominantly expressed in the brain but the functional significance of SGIP1 in SV recycling remains unknown. Here, we found that SGIP1α, a brain-specific long isoform of SGIP1 binds synaptotagmin1 (Syt1) via its μHD and promotes the internalization of Syt1 on the neuronal surface. The small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown (KD) of SGIP1α caused selective impairment of Syt1 internalization at hippocampal synapses and it was fully rescued by coexpression of the shRNA-resistant form of SGIP1α in KD neurons. We further found that the μHD of SGIP1α is structurally similar to those of AP-2 and stonin2, and mutations at Trp771 and Lys781, which correspond to Syt1-recognition motifs of AP-2 and stonin2, to Ala bound less efficiently to Syt1 and failed to rescue the endocytic defect of Syt1 caused by KD. Our results indicate that SGIP1α is an endocytic adaptor dedicated to the retrieval of surface-stranded Syt1. Since endocytic sorting of Syt1 is also mediated by the overlapping activities of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A/B (SV2A/B) and stonin2, our results suggest that complementary fail-safe mechanism by these proteins ensures high fidelity of Syt1 retrieval.},

   abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of CB1 palmitoylation in modulating the functional interaction with G proteins both in the absence and presence of agonist binding. Our data show that the nonpalmitoylated CB1 receptor significantly reduced its association with Gαi2. The agonist stimulation induced a partial dissociation of Gαi2 proteins from the wild-type receptor, while on the C415A mutant the agonist binding was not able to induce a significant dissociation of Gαi2 from the receptor. The lack of palmitoyl chain seems to hamper the ability of the receptor to functionally interact with the Gαi2 and indicate that the palmitoyl chain is responsible for the functional transmission of the agonist-induced conformational change in the receptor of the G protein. These data were further corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Overall these results suggest that palmitoylation of the CB1 receptor finely tunes its interaction with G proteins and serves as a targeting signal for its functional regulation. Of note, the possibility to reversibly modulate the palmitoylation of CB1 receptor may offer a coordinated process of regulation and could open new therapeutic approaches.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) mediate the presynaptic effects of endocannabinoids in the central nervous system (CNS) and most behavioral effects of exogenous cannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) binds to the CB1R C-terminus and can attenuate constitutive CB1R-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channel activity. We now demonstrate cellular colocalization of CRIP1a at neuronal elements in the CNS and show that CRIP1a inhibits both constitutive and agonist-stimulated CB1Rmediated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G-protein) activity. Stable overexpression of CRIP1a in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells stably expressing CB1Rs (CB1-HEK), or in N18TG2 cells endogenously expressing CB1Rs, decreased CB1Rmediated G-protein activation (measured by agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS (guanylyl-59-[O-thio]-triphosphate) binding) in both cell lines and attenuated inverse agonism by rimonabant in CB1-HEK cells. Conversely, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRIP1a in N18TG2 cells enhanced CB1R-mediated G-protein activation. These effects were not attributable to differences in CB1R expression or endocannabinoid tone because CB1R levels did not differ between cell lines varying in CRIP1a expression, and endocannabinoid levels were undetectable (CB1-HEK) or unchanged (N18TG2) by CRIP1a overexpression. In CB1-HEK cells, 4-hour pretreatment with cannabinoid agonists downregulated CB1Rs and desensitized agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding. CRIP1a overexpression attenuated CB1R downregulation without altering CB1R desensitization. Finally, in cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons, CRIP1a overexpression attenuated both depolarizationinduced suppression of excitation and inhibition of excitatory synaptic activity induced by exogenous application of cannabinoid but not by adenosine A1 agonists. These results confirm that CRIP1a inhibits constitutive CB1R activity and demonstrate that CRIP1a can also inhibit agonist-stimulated CB1R signaling and downregulation of CB1Rs. Thus, CRIP1a appears to act as a broad negative regulator of CB1R function.},

This is largely achieved via cell-surface receptors which mediate processes ranging from nutrient uptake to signaling responses. Consequently, their surface levels have to be dynamically controlled. Endocytosis constitutes a powerful mechanism to regulate the surface proteome and to recycle vesicular transmembrane proteins that strand at the plasma membrane after exocytosis. For efficient internalization, the cargo proteins need to be linked to the endocytic machinery via adaptor proteins such as the heterotetrameric endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 and a variety of mostly monomeric endocytic adaptors. In line with the importance of endocytosis for nutrient uptake, cell signaling and neurotransmission, animal models and human mutations have revealed that defects in these adaptors are associated with several diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to encephalopathies. This review will discuss the physiological functions of the so far known adaptor proteins and will provide a comprehensive overview of their links to human diseases.},

Here, a peptide corresponding to the full-length C-tail of the human CB1 receptor (residues 400-472) was expressed in E.coli and purified in a soluble form. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that the peptide adopts an α-helical conformation in negatively charged and zwitterionic detergents (48-51% and 36-38%, respectively), whereas it exhibited the CD signature of unordered structure at low concentration in aqueous solution. Interestingly, 27% helicity was displayed at high peptide concentration suggesting that self-association induces helix formation in the absence of a membrane mimetic. NMR spectroscopy of the doubly labeled (15N- and 13C-) C-terminus in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) identified two amphipathic α-helical domains. The first domain, S401-F412, corresponds to the helix 8 common to G protein-coupled receptors while the second domain, A440-M461, is a newly identified structural motif in the distal region of the carboxyl-terminus of the receptor. Molecular modeling of the C-tail in DPC indicates that both helices lie parallel to the plane of the membrane with their hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces poised for critical interactions. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The cannabinoid receptors have been the targets of intensive drug discovery efforts, because modulation of these receptors has therapeutic potential to control pain, epilepsy, obesity, and other disorders. Although much progress in understanding the biophysical properties of GPCRs has recently been made, investigations of the molecular mechanisms of the cannabinoids and their receptors have lacked high-resolution structural data. Here we report the use of GPCR engineering and lipidic cubic phase crystallization to determine the structure of the human CB1 receptor bound to the inhibitor taranabant at 2.6-Å resolution. We found that the extracellular surface of CB1, including the highly conserved membrane-proximal N-terminal region, is distinct from those of other lipid-activated GPCRs, forming a critical part of the ligand-binding pocket. Docking studies further demonstrate how this same pocket may accommodate the cannabinoid agonist THC.

We compared the signal transduction capabilities of CB1 with those of an L7.60F mutation and an L7.60I mutation that mimics the CB2 sequence. The two mutant receptors differed from wild type (WT) in their ability to regulate G-proteins in the [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay. The L7.60F receptor exhibited attenuated stimulation by agonists WIN-55,212-2 and CP-55,940 but not HU-210, whereas the L7.60I receptor exhibited impaired stimulation by all agonists tested as well as by the inverse agonist rimonabant. The mutants internalized more rapidly than WT receptors but could equally sequester G-proteins from the somatostatin receptor. Both the time course and maximal N-type Ca2+ current inhibition by WIN-55,212-2 were reduced in the mutants. Reconstitution experiments with pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins revealed loss of coupling to Gαi3 but not Gα0A in the L7.60I mutant, whereas the reduction in the time course for the L7.60F mutant was governed by Gαi3. Furthermore, Gαi3 but not Gα0A enhanced basal facilitation ratio, suggesting that Gαi3 is responsible for CB1 tonic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that both mutant receptors were associated with Gαi1 or Gαi2 but not with Gαi3. Molecular dynamics simulations of WT CB1 receptor and each mutant in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer suggested that the packing of H8 is different in each. The hydrogen bonding patterns along the helix backbones of each H8 also are different, as are the geometries of the elbow region of H8 (R7.56(400)-K7.58(402)).

The induction of presynaptically silent synapses is a means of modulating synaptic strength, which is important for synaptic plasticity. Persistent activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) mutes GABAergic terminals, although it is unclear if CB1Rs can also induce silencing at glutamatergic synapses. Cerebellar granule cells were transfected with VGLUT1-pHluorin to visualise the exo-endocytotic cycle. We found that prolonged stimulation (10 min) of cannabinoid receptors with the agonist HU-210 induces the silencing of previously active synapses. However, the presynaptic silencing induced by HU-210 is transient as it reverses after 20 min. cAMP with forskolin prevented CB1R-induced synaptic silencing, via activation of the Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (Epac). Furthermore, Epac activation accelerated awakening of already silent boutons. Electron microscopy revealed that silencing was associated with synaptic vesicle (SV) redistribution within the nerve terminal, which diminished the number of vesicles close to the active zone of the plasma membrane. Finally, by combining functional and immunocytochemical approaches, we observed a strong correlation between the release capacity of the nerve terminals and RIM1α protein content, but not that of Munc13-1 protein. These results suggest that prolonged stimulation of cannabinoid receptors can transiently silence glutamatergic nerve terminals. © 2014 Ramírez-Franco et al.},

In about 60% of pairs, a cannabinoid agonist greatly reduced the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from presynaptic terminals. In most of such pairs but not in those insensitive to the agonist, depolarization of postsynaptic neurons and the resultant elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents, which is mainly due to reduction of GABA release.

Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) and inhibition (DSI) are the best characterized transient forms of endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic modulation. Stimulation protocols consisting of long-lasting voltage steps to the postsynaptic cell are routinely used to evoke DSE-DSI. Little is known, however, about more physiological conditions under which these molecules are released in vitro. Moreover, the occurrence in vivo of such forms of endocannabinoid-mediated modulation is still controversial. Here we show that physiologically relevant patterns of synaptic activity induce a transient suppression of excitatory transmission onto dopamine neurons in vitro. Accordingly, in vivo endocannabinoids depress the increase in firing and bursting activity evoked in dopamine neurons by prefrontal cortex stimulation. This phenomenon is selectively mediated by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), which activates presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors. 2-AG synthesis involves activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores.

Physiol Rev 83: 1017–1066, 2003; 10.1152/physrev.00004.2003.—Research of cannabinoid actions was boosted in the 1990s by remarkable discoveries including identification of endogenous compounds with cannabimimetic activity (endocannabinoids) and the cloning of their molecular targets, the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. Although the existence of an endogenous cannabinoid signaling system has been established for a decade, its physiological roles have just begun to unfold. In addition, the behavioral effects of exogenous cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active compound of hashish and marijuana, await explanation at the cellular and network levels. Recent physiological, pharmacological, and high-resolution anatomical studies provided evidence that the major physiological effect of cannabinoids is the regulation of neurotransmitter release via activation of presynaptic CB 1 receptors located on distinct types of axon terminals throughout the brain. Subsequent discoveries shed light on the functional consequences of this localization by demonstrating the involvement of endocannabinoids in retrograde signaling at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. In this review, we aim to synthesize recent progress in our understanding of the physiological roles of endocannabinoids in the brain. First, the synthetic pathways of endocannabinoids are discussed, along with the putative mechanisms of their release, uptake, and degradation. The fine-grain anatomical distribution of the neuronal cannabinoid receptor CB 1 is described in most brain areas, emphasizing its general presynaptic localization and role in controlling neurotransmitter release. Finally, the possible functions of endocannabinoids as retrograde synaptic signal molecules are discussed in relation to synaptic plasticity and network activity patterns.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids exert their psychomotor actions through the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in the brain. Genetic deletion of CB1 in mice causes various symptoms, including changes in locomotor activity, increased ring catalepsy, supraspinal hypoalgesia, and impaired memory extinction. Although the cerebellar cortex contains the highest level of CB1, severe cerebellum-related functional deficits have not been reported in CB1 knock-out mice. To clarify the roles of CB1 in cerebellar function, we subjected CB1 knock-out mice to a delay version of classical eyeblink conditioning. This paradigm is a test for cerebellum-dependent discrete motor learning, in which conditioned stimulus (CS) (352 m stone) and unconditioned stimulus (US) (100 ms periorbital electrical shock) are coterminated. We found that delay eyeblink conditioning performance was severely impaired in CB1 knock-out mice. In contrast, they exhibited normal performance in a trace version of eyeblink conditioning with 500 ms stimulus-free interval intervened between the CS offset and the US onset. This paradigm is a test for hippocampus-dependent associative learning. Sensitivity of CB1 knock-out mice to CS or US was normal, suggesting that impaired delay eyeblink conditioning is attributable to defects in association of responses to CS and US. We also found that intraperitoneal injection of the CB1 antagonist SR141716A [N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4- dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole carboxamide] to wild-type mice caused severe impairment in acquisition but not extinction of delay eyeblink conditioning. SR141716A treatment had no effect on trace eyeblink conditioning with a 500 or 750 ms trace interval. These results indicate that endogenous cannabinoid signaling through CB1 is essential for cerebellum-dependent discrete motor learning, especially for its acquisition.

To examine whether and how the endocannabinoid system contributes to reward-based learning of a motor sequence, we subjected male CB1-knockout (KO) and DGLα-KO mice to three types of operant lever-press tasks. First, we trained mice to press one of three levers labeled A, B, and C for a food reward (one-lever task). Second, we trained mice to press the three levers in the order of A, B, and C (three-lever task). Third, the order of the levers was reversed to C, B, and A (reverse three-lever task). We found that CB1-KO mice and DGLα-KO mice exhibited essentially the same deficits in the operant lever-press tasks. In the one-lever task, both strains of knockout mice showed a slower rate of learning to press a lever for food. In the three-lever task, both strains of knockout mice showed a slower rate of learning of the motor sequence. In the reverse three-lever task, both strains of knockout mice needed more lever presses for reversal learning. These results suggest that the endocannabinoid system facilitates reward-based learning of a motor sequence by conferring the flexibility with which animals can switch between strategies.},

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a pivotal pathway for synaptic plasticity because of its widely characterized ability to depress synaptic transmission on short- and long-term scales. Recent reports indicate that eCBs also mediate potentiation of the synapse. However, it is not known how eCB signaling may support bidirectionality. Here, we combined electrophysiology experiments with mathematical modeling to question the mechanisms of eCB bidirectionality in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal synapses. We demonstrate that STDP outcome is controlled by eCB levels and dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Moreover, we show that eCB-tLTD requires active calcineurin whereas eCB-tLTP necessitates the activity of presynaptic PKA. Therefore, just like glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system to encode learning and memory.},

Indeed, a BDNF-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at distal basal excitatory synapses of Layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) has been demonstrated in disinhibited rat barrel cortex slices. Although it is well established that this LTP requires the pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) with Ca2+ spikes, its induction when synaptic inhibition is working remains unexplored. Here we show that low-frequency stimulation at basal dendrites of L5PNs is able to trigger a PSP followed by an action potential (AP) and a slow depolarization (termed PSP-Ca2+ response) in thalamocortical slices without blocking synaptic inhibition. We demonstrate that AP barrage-mediated release of endocannabinoids (eCBs) from the recorded L5PNs induces PSP-Ca2+ response facilitation and BDNF-dependent LTP. Indeed, this LTP requires the type 1 cannabinoid receptors activation, is prevented by postsynaptic intracellular 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) or the anandamide membrane transporter inhibitor AM404, and only occurs in L5PNs neurons showing depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. Additionally, electrical stimulation at the posteromedial thalamic nucleus induced similar response and LTP. These results reveal a novel form of eCB-dependent LTP at L5PNs that could be relevant in the processing of sensory information in the barrel cortex.},

   abstract = {Given the extensive attenuation that can occur along dendritic cables, location within the dendritic tree might appear to be a dominant factor in determining the impact of a synapse on the postsynaptic response. By this reasoning, distal synapses should have a smaller effect than proximal ones. However, experimental evidence from several types of neurons, such as CA1 pyramidal cells, indicates that a compensatory strengthening of synapses counteracts the effect of location on synaptic efficacy. A form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), called anti-STDP, combined with non-Hebbian activity-dependent plasticity can account for the equalization of synaptic efficacies. This result, obtained originally in models with unbranched passive cables, also arises in multicompartment models with branched and active dendrites that feature backpropagating action potentials, including models with CA1 pyramidal morphologies. Additionally, when dendrites support the local generation of action potentials, anti-STDP prevents runaway dendritic spiking and locally balances the numbers of dendritic and backpropagating action potentials. Thus in multiple ways, anti-STDP eliminates the location dependence of synapses and allows Hebbian plasticity to operate in a more "democratic" manner.

   abstract = {The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by cannabimimetic compounds in a membrane fraction from cultured neuroblastoma cells has been examined. The inhibition was shown to be concentration-dependent over a nanomolar range for both Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and its synthetic analog, desacetyllevonantradol. Inhibition was rapid and reversible. The cannabimimetic compounds caused a decrease in V(max) of the enzyme, with no alteration in the K(m) for substrate. The effects of these compounds were related to the ability of the enzyme to be regulated by divalent cations and guanine nucleotides. The inhibition was greatest at micromolar Mg2+ or Mn2+ concentrations and was abolished at<1 mM MnCl2. In the hormone-stimulated state, the enzyme appeared to be regulated by one Mg2+ site. The addition of cannabimimetic or muscarinic cholinergic agents transformed the enzyme into one in which more complex regulation by divalent cations was observed. Half-maximal inhibition of adenylate cyclase was observed at 800 nM GTP for both cannabimimetic and muscarinic cholinergic agents. The substitution for GTP of a nonhydrolyzable analog resulted in activation of the enzyme and failure to respond to either class of inhibitory agents. If the Mg2+ concentration was reduced and exposure to the GTP analog was of short duration, inhibition by both cannabimimetic and muscarinic agents could be observed in the presence of forskolin. This study points to the similarities between the enzyme inhibition by cannabimimetic compounds and by muscarinic cholinergic compounds. It is inferred that the cannabimimetic compounds must act via regulatory mechanisms similar to those operating for receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase.},

In addition, eCBs can modify the inducibility of non-eCB-mediated forms of plasticity. Thus, the eCB system is emerging as a major player in synaptic plasticity.

In this response, mGlu7 receptor triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein activation, reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx and the subsequent depolarization evoked release. Here we report that receptor coupling to signaling pathways that potentiate release can be seen following prolonged exposure of nerve terminals to the agonist L-(+)-phosphonobutyrate, L-AP4. This novel mGlu7 receptor response involves an increase in the release induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, suggesting a mechanism that is independent of Ca 2+ channel activity, but dependent on the downstream exocytotic release machinery. The mGlu7 receptor-mediated potentiation resists exposure to pertussis toxin, but is dependent on phospholipase C, and increased phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Furthermore, the potentiation of release does not depend on protein kinase C, although it is blocked by the diacylglycerol-binding site antagonist calphostin C. We also found that activation of mGlu7 receptors translocate the active zone protein essential for synaptic vesicle priming, munc13-1, from soluble to particulate fractions. We propose that the mGlu7 receptor can facilitate or inhibit glutamate release through multiple pathways, thereby exerting homeostatic control of presynaptic function. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

This review aims at explaining how the site-specific actions of the endocannabinoid system impact on memory and feeding behavior through the cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1R). Centrally, CB1R is widely distributed in many brain regions, different cell types (e.g. neuronal or glial cells) and intracellular compartments (e.g. mitochondria). Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects are differentially mediated by CB1R according to their cell-type localization (e.g. glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons).

For this reason, there is a tremendous medical interest in harnessing the beneficial effects of THC. Behavioral studies carried out in mice lacking 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2AR) revealed a remarkable 5-HT2AR-dependent dissociation in the beneficial antinociceptive effects of THC and its detrimental amnesic properties. We found that specific effects of THC such as memory deficits, anxiolytic-like effects, and social interaction are under the control of 5- HT2AR, but its acute hypolocomotor, hypothermic, anxiogenic, and antinociceptive effects are not. In biochemical studies, we show that CB1R and 5-HT2AR form heteromers that are expressed and functionally active in specific brain regions involved in memory impairment. Remarkably, our functional data shows that costimulation of both receptors by agonists reduces cell signaling, antagonist binding to one receptor blocks signaling of the interacting receptor, and heteromer formation leads to a switch in G-protein coupling for 5-HT2AR from Gq to Gi proteins. Synthetic peptides with the sequence of transmembrane helices 5 and 6 of CB1R, fused to a cell-penetrating peptide, were able to disrupt receptor heteromerization in vivo, leading to a selective abrogation of memory impairments caused by exposure to THC. These data reveal a novel molecular mechanism for the functional interaction between CB1R and 5-HT2AR mediating cognitive impairment. CB1R-5-HT2AR heteromers are thus good targets to dissociate the cognitive deficits induced by THC from its beneficial antinociceptive properties.},

This induces rapid neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of neurites and axonal growth cones, elevated neuronal rigidity, and reshaping of somatodendritic morphology. Chronic pharmacological inhibition of NM II prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of dendritic development in vitro and leads, similarly to blockade of endocannabinoid action, to excessive growth of corticofugal axons into the sub-ventricular zone in vivo. Our results suggest that CB1R can rapidly transform the neuronal cytoskeleton through actomyosin contractility, resulting in cellular remodeling events ultimately able to affect the brain architecture and wiring.},

Seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) receptors/GPCRs can form homoand heteromers and initiate distinct signaling pathways. Recently, several synthetic CB1 receptor inverse agonists/antagonists, such as SR141716A, AM251, and AM281, were reported to activate GPR55. Of these, SR141716A was marketed as a promising anti-obesity drug, but was withdrawn from the market because of severe side effects. Here, we tested whether GPR55 and CB1 receptors are capable of (i) forming heteromers and (ii) whether such heteromers could exhibit novel signaling patterns. We show that GPR55 and CB1 receptors alter each others signaling properties in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We demonstrate that the co-expression of FLAG-CB1 receptors in cells stably expressing HA-GPR55 specifically inhibits GPR55-mediated transcription factor activation, such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells and serum response element, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activation. GPR55 and CB1 receptors can form heteromers, but the internalization of both receptors is not affected. In addition, we observe that the presence of GPR55 enhances CB1R-mediated ERK1/2 and nuclear factor of activated T-cell activation. Our data provide the first evidence that GPR55 can form heteromers with another 7TM/GPCR and that this interaction with the CB1 receptor has functional consequences in vitro. The GPR55-CB1R heteromer may play an important physiological and/or pathophysiological role in tissues endogenously co-expressing both receptors.},

These findings led to the identification of a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that provides a direct link between Gα12/13 and Rho stimulation. Recent observations suggest that many cellular responses elicited by Gαq and its coupled receptors also require the functional activity of Rho. However, available evidence suggests that Gαq may act on pathways downstream from Rho rather than by promoting Rho activation. These seemingly conflicting observations and the recent development of sensitive assays to assess the in vivo levels of active Rho prompted us to ask whether Gαq and its coupled receptors can stimulate endogenous Rho. Here we show that the expression of activated forms of Gαq and the stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors or chimeric Gαq molecules that respond to Gi-linked receptors can promote a robust activation of endogenous Rho in HEK-293T cells. Interestingly, this response was not prevented by molecules interfering with the ability of Gα13 to stimulate its linked RhoGEFs, together suggesting the existence of a novel molecular mechanism by which Gαq and the large family of Gq-coupled receptors can regulate the activity of Rho and its downstream signaling pathways.},

   abstract = {The long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF) synapses onto Purkinje cells plays a central role in motor learning. Endocannabinoid release and LTD induction both depend upon activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1, require postsynaptic calcium increases, are synapse specific, and have a similar dependence on the associative activation of PF and climbing fiber synapses. These similarities suggest that endocannabinoid release could account for many features of cerebellar LTD. Here we show that LTD induction is blocked by a cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) antagonist, by inhibiting the synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), and is absent in mice lacking the CB1R. Although CB1Rs are prominently expressed presynaptically at PF synapses, LTD is expressed postsynaptically. In contrast, a previously described transient form of inhibition mediated by endocannabinoids is expressed presynaptically. This indicates that Purkinje cells release 2-AG that activates CB1Rs to both transiently inhibit release and induce a postsynaptic form of LTD. Copyright ©2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The psychoactive properties of Cannabis sativa and its major biologically active constituent, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, have been known for years. The recent identification and cloning of a specific cannabinoid receptor suggest that cannabinoids mimic endogenous compounds affecting neural signals for mood, memory, movement, and pain. Using whole-cell voltage clamp and the cannabinomimetic aminoalkylindole WIN 55,212-2, we have found that cannabinoid receptor activation reduces the amplitude of voltage-gated calcium currents in the neuroblastoma-glioma cell line NG108-15. The inhibition is potent, being half-maximal at less than 10 nM, and reversible. The inactive enantiomer, WIN 55,212-3, does not reduce calcium currents even at 1 μM. Of the several types of calcium currents in NG108-15 cells, cannabinoids predominantly inhibit an ω-conotoxin-sensitive, high-voltage- activated calcium current. Inhibition was blocked by incubation with pertussis toxin but was not altered by prior treatment with hydrolysis- resistant cAMP analogues together with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, suggesting that the transduction pathway between the cannabinoid receptor and calcium channel involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein and is independent of cAMP metabolism. However, the development of inhibition is considerably slower than a pharmacologically similar pathway used by an α2- adrenergic receptor in these cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of N- type calcium channels, which could decrease excitability and neurotransmitter release, may underlie some of the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids are released from neurons in activity-dependent manners, act retrogradely on presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors, and induce short-term or long-term suppression of transmitter release. The endocannabinoid release is triggered by postsynaptic activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and/or Gq-coupled receptors such as group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (I-mGluRs) and M1/M3 muscarinic receptors. However, the roles of NMDA receptors, which provide another pathway for Ca2+ entry into neurons, in endocannabinoid signalling have been poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the possible contribution of NMDA receptors in endocannabinoid production by recording IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Under the conditions minimizing the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, local application of NMDA (200 μm) transiently suppressed cannabinoid-sensitive IPSCs, but not cannabinoid-insensitive IPSCs. This NMDA-induced suppression was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors, CB1 receptors and diacylglycerol lipase, but not by inhibiting voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. When the postsynaptic neuron was dialysed with 30 m m BAPTA, the NMDA-induced suppression was reduced significantly. A lower dose of NMDA (20 μ m) exerted little effect when applied alone, but markedly enhanced the cannabinoid-dependent suppression driven by muscarinic receptors or I-mGluRs. These data clearly indicate that the activation of NMDA receptors facilitates the endocannabinoid release either alone or in concert with the Gq-coupled receptors. © 2007 The Authors.

   abstract = {Several classes of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) are inhibited by G proteins activated by receptors for neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory peptides. Evidence has accumulated to indicate that for non-L-type Ca2+ channels the executing arm of the activated G protein is its betagamma dimer (Gbetagamma). We report below the existence of two Gbetagamma-binding sites on the A-, B-, and E-type alpha1 subunits that form non-L-type Ca2+ channels. One, reported previously, is in loop 1 connecting transmembrane domains I and II. The second is located approximately in the middle of the ca. 600-aa-long C-terminal tails. Both Gbetagamma-binding regions also bind the Ca2+ channel beta subunit (CCbeta), which, when overexpressed, interferes with inhibition by activated G proteins. Replacement in alpha1E of loop 1 with that of the G protein-insensitive and Gbetagamma-binding-negative loop 1 of alpha1C did not abolish inhibition by G proteins, but the exchange of the alpha1E C terminus with that of alpha1C did. This and properties of alpha1E C-terminal truncations indicated that the Gbetagamma-binding site mediating the inhibition of Ca2+ channel activity is the one in the C terminus. Binding of Gbetagamma to this site was inhibited by an alpha1-binding domain of CCbeta, thus providing an explanation for the functional antagonism existing between CCbeta and G protein inhibition. The data do not support proposals that Gbetagamma inhibits alpha1 function by interacting with the site located in the loop I-II linker. These results define the molecular mechanism by which presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors inhibit neurotransmission.},

   abstract = {1. In the rodent cerebellum, both presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors and presynaptic mGluR4 metabotropic glutamate receptors acutely depress excitatory synaptic transmission at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses. Using rat cerebellar slices, we have analysed the effects of selective CB1 and mGluR4 agonists on the presynaptic Ca2+ influx which controls glutamate release at this synapse. 2. Changes in presynaptic Ca2+ influx were determined with the Ca2+-sensitive dyes fluo-4FF AM or fluo-3 AM. Five stimulations delivered at 100 Hz or single stimulations of parallel fibres evoked rapid and reproducible transient increases in presynaptic fluo-4FF or fluo-3 fluorescence, respectively, which decayed to prestimulus levels within a few hundred milliseconds. Bath application of the selective CB1 agonist WIN55,212-2 (1 μM) markedly reduced the peak amplitude of these fluorescence transients. This effect was fully reversed by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716-A (1 μM). 3. Bath application of the selective mGluR4 agonist L-AP4 (100 μM) also caused a transient decrease in the peak amplitude of the fluorescence transients evoked by parallel fibre stimulation. 4. Bath application of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP (1 mM) totally prevented both the WIN55,212-2- and the L-AP4-induced inhibition of peak fluorescence transients evoked by parallel fibre stimulation. 5. The present study demonstrates that activation of CB1 and mGluR4 receptors inhibits presynaptic Ca2+ influx evoked by parallel fibre stimulation via the activation of presynaptic K+ channels, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition involve an indirect inhibition of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels rather than their direct inhibition.},

   abstract = {Activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the cerebellum acutely depresses excitatory synaptic transmission at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses by decreasing the probability of glutamate release. This depression involves the activation of presynaptic 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K+ channels by CB1 receptors, which in turn inhibits presynaptic Ca2+ influx controlling glutamate release at these synapses. Using rat cerebellar frontal slices and fluorometric measures of presynaptic Ca2+ influx evoked by stimulation of parallel fibres with the fluorescent dye fluo-4FF, we tested whether the CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of this influx also involves a direct inhibition of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. Since various physiological effects of CB1 receptors appear to be mediated through the activation of PTX-sensitive proteins, including inhibition of adenylate cyclases, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and activation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels, we also studied the potential involvement of these intracellular signal transduction pathways in the cannabinoid-mediated depression of presynaptic Ca2+ influx. The present study demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms underlying the CB1 inhibitory effect involve the activation of the PTX-sensitive Gi/Go subclass of G proteins, independently of any direct effect on presynaptic Ca2+ channels (N, P/Q and R (SNX-482-sensitive) types) or on adenylate cyclase or MAPK activity, but do require the activation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying (Ba2+-and tertiapin Q-sensitive) K+ channels, in addition to 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K+ channels. © The Physiological Society 2004.},

   abstract = {We studied the mechanisms by which GABA release is reduced in the retrograde signaling process called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). DSI is mediated by endocannabinoids in acute and cultured organotypic hippocampal slices. We examined a variety of K+ channel antagonists to determine the nature of the K+ channel that, when blocked, reduces DSI. Among 4-AP, TEA, dendrotoxin, Cs, margatoxin, and charybdotoxin, only 4-AP was highly effective in blocking DSI, suggesting that a K+ channel composed in part of KV1.4KV1.5 or KV1.7 subunits can readily regulate DSI. The inhibition of DSI by 4-AP is largely overcome by reducing [Ca2+]o, however, suggesting that DSI expression can be prevented by saturation of the release process when a KV1.X channel is inhibited. DSI of agatoxin- and TTX-insensitive mIPSCs was unaffected by 4-AP, but was largely occluded by ω-conotoxin GVIA, indicating that block of presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels is probably a major mechanism of DSI expression. Significant DSI of mIPSCs remained in ω-conotoxin, hence we infer that block of N-channels does not fully explain hippocampal DSI expression. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Glutamate transmission between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and accumbens (NAc) plays a crucial role in the establishment and expression of addictive behaviors. At these synapses exogenous cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) agonists reversibly inhibit excitatory transmission, and the sustained release of endogenous cannabinoids (eCB) following prolonged cortical stimulation leads to long-term depression (LTD). Activation of presynaptic K+ channels mediates the effects of exocannabinoids, but the transduction pathway underlying the protracted phase of eCB-LTD is unknown. Here we report that the maintenance of eCB-LTD does not involve presynaptic K+ channels: eCB-LTD was not affected by blockade of K+ channels with 4-AP (100 μM) and BaCl2 (300 μM) (fEPSP = 78.9 ± 5.4% of baseline 58-60 min after tetanus, compared to 78.9 ± 5.9% in control slices). In contrast, eCB-LTD was blocked by treatment of the slices with the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator forskolin (10 μM), and with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT5720 (1 μM) (fEPSP = 108.9 ± 5.7% in forskolin and 110.5 ± 7.7% in KT5720, compared to 80.6 ± 3.9% in control conditions). Additionally, selective blockade of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels with ω-agatoxin-IVA (200 nM) occluded the expression of eCB-LTD (fEPSP = 113.4 ± 15.9% compared to 78.6 ± 4.4% in control slices), while blockade of N- with ω-conotoxin-GVIA (1 μM) or L-type Ca2+ channels with nimodipine (1 μM), was without effect (fEPSP was 83.7 ± 5.3% and 87 ± 8.9% respectively). These data show that protracted inhibition of AC/PKA activity and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels are necessary for expression of eCB-LTD at NAc synapses. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Both endocannabinoids through cannabinoid receptor type I (CB1) receptors and dopamine through dopamine receptor type D1 receptors modulate postsynaptic inhibition in substantia nigra by changing GABA release from striatonigral terminals. By recording from visually identified pars compacta and pars reticulata neurons we searched for a possible co-release and interaction of endocannabinoids and dopamine. Depolarization of a neuron in pars reticulata or in pars compacta transiently suppressed evoked synaptic currents which were blocked by GABAA receptor antagonists (inhibitory postsynaptic currents [IPSCs]). This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) was abrogated by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 μM). A correlation existed between the degree of DSI and the degree of reduction of evoked IPSCs by the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (1 μM). The cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol (0.5-5 μM) enhanced DSI, but suppression of spontaneous IPSCs was barely detectable pointing to the existence of GABA release sites without CB1 receptors. In dopamine, but not in GABAergic neurons DSI was enhanced by the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (3-10 μM). Both the antagonist for CB1 receptors and the antagonist for dopamine D1 receptors enhanced or reduced, respectively, the amplitudes of evoked IPSCs. This tonic influence persisted if the receptor for the other ligand was blocked. We conclude that endocannabinoids and dopamine can be co-released. Retrograde signaling through endocannabinoids and dopamine changes inhibition independently from each other. Activation of dopamine D1 receptors emphasizes extrinsic inhibition and activation of CB1 receptors promotes intrinsic inhibition. © 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we demonstrate that hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons release endocannabinoids continuously under basal conditions, unlike other release sites at which endocannabinoid production must be stimulated. The basal endocannabinoid release selectively inhibited GABA release onto POMC neurons, although exogenous administration of cannabinoid agonists also inhibited glutamate release. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 251 [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H- pyrazole-3-carboxamide] blocked endocannabinoid-mediated inhibition of GABA release without affecting excitatory synaptic currents, whereas the CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 [R-(+)-(2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl] pyrol [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl)(1-naphthalenyl) methanone monomethanesulfonate] inhibited both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents in POMC neurons. These data demonstrate that endogenously released cannabinoids and exogenously applied CB1 receptor agonists can have markedly different effects on synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the data suggest a novel form of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde inhibition, whereby the regulation of a subset of inputs requires either the removal of tonic presynaptic inhibition caused by endocannabinoids or the engagement of a mechanism that actively inhibits endocannabinoid production.

   abstract = {Modulation of neurotransmitter release by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a prominent presynaptic mechanism for regulation of synaptic transmission. Activation of GPCRs located at the presynaptic terminal can decrease the probability of neurotransmitter release. This presynaptic depression involves activationof Gi/o-type G-proteins that mediate different inhibitory mechanisms, including inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, activation of potassium channels, and direct inhibition of the vesicle fusion process. A variety of neurotransmitters and modulatory agents can activate GPCRs that produce presynaptic depression. Among these are lipid metabolites that serve as agonists for GPCRs. The discovery of endocannabinoids and their cognate receptors, including the CB1 receptor, has stimulated intense investigation into the neurophysiological roles of these lipid metabolites. It is now clear that presynaptic depression is the major physiological role for the CB1 receptor. Endocannabinoids activate this receptor mainly via a retrograde signaling process in which these compounds are synthesized in and released from postsynaptic neuronal elements, and travel back to the presynaptic terminal to act on the CB1 receptor. This retrograde endocannabinoid modulation has been implicated in short-term synaptic depression, including suppression of excitatory or inhibitory transmission induced by postsynaptic depolarization and transient synaptic depression induced by activation of postsynaptic GPCRs during agonist treatment or synaptic activation. Endocannabinoids and the CB1 receptor also play a key role in one form of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) that involves a longlasting decrease in neurotransmitter release. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Although endocannabinoid release is induced by either depolarization or activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, it is markedly enhanced by the coincidence of depolarization and receptor activation. Here we report that this coincidence is detected by phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) in hippocampal neurons. By measuring cannabinoid-sensitive synaptic currents, we found that the receptor-driven endocannabinoid release was dependent on physiological levels of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and markedly enhanced by depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. Furthermore, we measured PLC activity in intact neurons by using exogenous TRPC6 channel as a biosensor for the PLC product diacylglycerol and found that the receptor-driven PLC activation exhibited similar [Ca2+]i dependence to that of endocannabinoid release. Neither endocannabinoid release nor PLC activation was induced by receptor activation in PLCβ1 knockout mice. We therefore conclude that PLCβ1 serves as a coincidence detector through its Ca2+ dependency for endocannabinoid release in hippocampal neurons.},

   abstract = {The cholinergic system in the CNS plays important roles in higher brain functions, primarily through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. At cellular levels, muscarinic activation produces various effects including modulation of synaptic transmission. Here we report that muscarinic activation suppresses hippocampal inhibitory transmission through two distinct mechanisms, namely a cannabinoid-dependent and cannabinoid-independent mechanism. We made paired whole-cell recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons of rats and mice, and monitored inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). When cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) was blocked, oxotremorine M (oxo-M), a muscarinic agonist, suppressed IPSCs in a subset of neuron pairs. This suppression was associated with an increase in paired-pulse ratio, blocked by the M2-prefering antagonist gallamine, and was totally absent in neuron pairs from M 2-knockout mice. When CB1 receptors were not blocked, oxo-M suppressed IPSCs in a gallamine-resistant manner in cannabinoid-sensitive pairs. This suppression was associated with an increase in paired-pulse ratio, blocked by the CB1 antagonist AM281, and was completely eliminated in neuron pairs from M1/M3-compound-knockout mice. Our immunohistochemical examination showed that M2 and CB1 receptors were present at inhibitory presynaptic terminals of mostly different origins. These results indicate that two distinct mechanisms mediate the muscarinic suppression. In a subset of synapses, activation of M2 receptors at presynaptic terminals suppresses GABA release directly. In contrast, in a different subset of synapses, activation of M1/M3 receptors causes endocannabinoid production and subsequent suppression of GABA release by activating presynaptic CB1 receptors. Thus, the muscarinic system can influence hippocampal functions by controlling different subsets of inhibitory synapses through the two distinct mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids are retrograde messengers that are released from central neurons by depolarization-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]I or by activation of a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). We studied the interaction between these two pathways for endocannabinoid production in rat hippocampal neurons. We made a paired whole-cell recording from cultured hippocampal neurons with inhibitory synaptic connections. Activation of group I mGluRs, mainly mGluR5, by the specific agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), suppressed inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in about half of the neuron pairs. A cannabinoid agonist, WIN55,212-2, suppressed IPSCs in all DHPG-sensitive pairs but not in most of DHPG-insensitive pairs. The effects of both DHPG and WIN55,212-2 were abolished by the cannabinoid antagonists, AM281 and SR141716A, indicating that activation of group I mGluR releases endocannabinoids and suppress inhibitory neurotransmitter release through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. Depolarization of the postsynaptic neurons caused a transient suppression of IPSCs, a phenomenon termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) that was also abolished by cannabinoid antagonists. Importantly, DSI was enhanced significantly when group I mGluRs were activated simultaneously by DHPG. This enhancement was much more prominent than expected from the simple summation of depolarization-induced and group I mGluR-induced endocannabinoid release. DHPG caused no change in depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients, indicating that the enhanced DSI by DHPG was not due to the augmentation of Ca2+ influx. Enhancement of DSI by DHPG was also observed in hippocampal slices. These results suggest that two pathways work in a cooperative manner to release endocannabinoids via a common intracellular cascade.},

   abstract = {The sensitivity to GABA of Purkinje cells in thin cerebellar slices was examined by recording either spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents or ionic currents elicited by local GABA applications. The effects of Ca2+ entry induced by depolarizing voltage pulses were opposite for the two types of currents. Currents due to exogenous GABA applications were increased by a train of voltage pulses. This potentiation was transient with an average half recovery period of 3.7 min. Spontaneous synaptic currents were reduced by depolarizing voltage pulses, with a half recovery time of about 20 s. The inhibition was largely explained by a decrease of the frequency of synaptic events, suggesting that the primary location of the effect was presynaptic. Thus, a Cal' rise increases the sensitivity of Purkinje cells to GABA and induces a retrograde inhibition of presynaptic terminals. The latter effect may be due to a diffusible Ca2+-dependent messenger. © 1991.},

With high-resistance, Cl--filled electrodes, which inverted and enlarged the responses at normal resting potentials, we examined spontaneous GABA-mediated IPSPs. Usually we recorded the spontaneous events in the presence of carbachol (10-25 μM), which significantly increased IPSP frequency and blocked potentially confounding K+ conductances. Following a train of action potentials, spontaneous IPSPs were transiently suppressed. This suppression could not be accounted for by membrane conductance changes following the train or activation of a recurrent circuit. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in the slice indicated that the amplitudes of the spontaneous GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were also diminished following the action potential train. In some cases BAY K 8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist, enhanced the suppression of IPSPs, while buffering changes in [Ca2+](i) with EGTA or BAPTA prevented it. The monosynaptically evoked IPSC in the presence of 6-cyano-7- nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APN) was also diminished following a train of action potentials; however, iontophoretically applied GABA responses did not change significantly. These studies suggest that localized physiological changes in postsynaptic [Ca2+](i) potently modulate synaptic GABA(A) inputs and that this modulation may be an important regulatory mechanism in mammalian brain.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling exerts powerful control over synaptic transmission in many brain areas. However, in the neocortex, the precise laminar, cellular, and subcellular localization of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) as well as its function has been elusive. Here we combined multiple immunolabeling with whole-cell recordings to investigate the morpho-functional characteristics of cannabinoid signaling in rat somatosensory cortex. Immunostaining for CB1 revealed axonal and somatic labeling with striking layer specificity: a high density of CB 1-positive fibers was seen in layers II-III, in layer VI, and in upper layer V, whereas other layers had sparse (layer IV) or hardly any (layer I) staining. Membrane staining for CB1 was only found in axon terminals, all of which contained GABA and formed symmetric synapses. Double immunostaining also revealed that CB1-positive cells formed two neurochemically distinct subpopulations: two-thirds were cholecystokinin positive and one-third expressed calbindin, each subserving specific inhibitory functions in cortical networks. In addition, cannabinoid sensitivity of GABAergic input showed striking layer specificity, as revealed by both electrophysiological and anatomical experiments. We found a unique population of large pyramidal neurons in layer VB that received much less perisomatic innervation from CB1-expressing GABAergic axon terminals and, accordingly, showed no depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, unlike pyramidal cells in layer II, and a population of small pyramidal cells in layer V. This suggests that inhibitory control of pyramidal cells involved in intracortical or corticostriatal processing is fine-tuned by activity-dependent endocannabinoid signaling, whereas inhibition of pyramidal cells relaying cortical information to lower subcortical effector centers often lacks this plasticity.

   abstract = {Retrograde synaptic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) is a recently discovered form of neuromodulation in the brain. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), endocannabinoid signaling has been implicated in learning and memory, specifically in extinction of aversive memories. To examine retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in this brain region, BLA neurons were freshly isolated using an enzyme-free procedure. These isolated neurons retain attached functional excitatory and inhibitory synaptic boutons. Spontaneous GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs) were isolated from these freshly isolated neurons and a 4 s step of depolarization from - 60 to 0 mV produced suppression of sIPSC frequency and amplitude. A similar depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) was observed in neurons in BLA slices. DSI in the single-cell preparation was abolished by the CB1 receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole- 3-carboxamide, and DSI duration was shortened in the presence of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine, an mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5) antagonist. The initial decrease in sIPSCs induced by the DSI procedure was greatly attenuated in recordings with 20 mM BAPTA containing postsynaptic internal solution, but a delayed-onset decrease was observed under this recording condition. A CB1 agonist decreased sIPSC frequency and amplitude, whereas CB1 antagonists increased these responses. The antagonist-induced increase was abolished in 20 mM BAPTA-filled cells. These data provide solid evidence for retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the BLA and also indicate that this retrograde signaling requires only a postsynaptic neuron and attached synaptic boutons.

   abstract = {Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) act as retrograde inhibitory messengers in various regions of the brain. We have recently reported that endocannabinoids mediate short-term retrograde suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission from the neocortex to medium spiny (MS) neurons, the major projection neurons from the striatum. However, it remains unclear whether endocannabinoids modulate inhibitory transmission in the striatum. Here we show that depolarization of MS neurons induces transient suppression of inhibition that is mediated by retrograde endocannabinoid signalling. By paired recording from a fast-spiking (FS) interneuron and an MS neuron, we demonstrated that FS-MS inhibitory synapses undergo endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression. We verified that GABAergic inhibitory terminals immunopositive for parvalbumin (PV), a marker for FS interneurons, expressed CB1 receptors. These PV-CB1 double-positive terminals surrounded dopamine D1 receptor-positive and D2 receptor-positive MS neurons; these constitute direct and indirect pathways, respectively. These results suggest that endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression of inhibition influences information flow along both direct and indirect pathways, depending on the activity of MS neurons. © The Authors (2006).},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids are emerging as potent modulators of neuronal activity throughout the brain, and activation of the type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) reduces sensory-evoked cortical responses in vivo, presumably by decreasing excitatory transmission. In the neocortex, CB1R is differentially expressed across neocortical laminae, with highest levels of expression in layers 2/3 and 5. Although we have shown that cannabinoid signaling in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex targets both γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release, the predominant effect is a net increase in pyramidal neuron (PN) activity due to disinhibition. The role of endocannabinoid signaling in layer 5, the main output layer of the neocortex, remains unknown. We found that inducing activity in layer 5 PNs resulted in endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), whereas the majority of inhibitory inputs were cannabinoid insensitive. Furthermore, in contrast to layer 2/3, the net effect of elevations in action potential firing of layer 5 PNs was an endocannabinoid-mediated decrease in PN spike probability. Interestingly, excitatory synaptic currents in layer 5 evoked by intralaminar stimulation were cannabinoid sensitive, whereas inputs evoked from layer 2/3 were insensitive, suggesting specificity of cannabinoid signaling across glutamatergic inputs. Thus, cannabinoids have differential effects on excitation and inhibition across cortical layers, and endocannabinoid signaling in layer 5 may serve to selectively decrease the efficacy of a subset of excitatory inputs. © The Author 2006.

   abstract = {The dentate gyrus is a key input gateway for the hippocampus, and dentate function is potently regulated by GABAergic inhibition. GABAergic inhibition is plastic and modulated by many factors. Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca+]i) is one of these factors, and its elevation inhibits GABA-mediated transmission in the hippocampus including the dentate gyrus granule cells (DGCs). We examined whether the [Ca+]i-dependent decrease of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) is explained by the retrograde suppression of GABA release caused by the depolarization-induced elevation of [Ca+]i in DGCs (DSI: depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition). Repeated brief depolarizations or a single long depolarization inhibited spontaneous IPSCs with amplitudes over 25 pA for up to a minute, and reduced the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by direct stimulation in the molecular layer, suggesting that DGCs are susceptible to DSI. The magnitude of DSI correlated linearly with the duration of depolarization, and so did the increase of [Ca+]i. DSI was blocked by intrapipette application of BAPTA. In addition, bath application of thapsigargin and ryanodine, and intrapipette application of ryanodine and ruthenium red reduced the [Ca+]i increase caused by the DSI-inducing depolarization, and substantially reduced the magnitude of DSI. Finally, the cannabinoid receptor agonists, CP55,942 and WIN55,212-2, mimicked DSI and prevented further IPSC reduction by DSI. DSI was blocked by the antagonist, SR141716A. We conclude that GABAergic inhibition in DGCs is subject to endogenous cannabinoid (eCB)-mediated retrograde regulation, and this process involves a depolarization-initiated release of Ca+ from ryanodine-sensitive stores. Our findings suggest eCBs probably have physiological functions in the regulation of GABAergic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. © The Physiological Society 2005.},

   abstract = {In the neocortex, inhibitory interneurons tightly regulate the firing patterns and integrative properties of pyramidal neurons (PNs). The endocannabinoid system of the neocortex may play an important role in the activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory (i.e., GABAergic) inputs received by PNs. In the present study, using whole cell recordings from layer 2/3 PNs in slices of mouse sensory cortex, we have identified a role for PN-derived endocannabinoids in the control of afferent inhibitory strength. Pairing evoked inhibitory currents with repeated epochs of postsynaptic depolarization led to a transient suppression of inhibition that was induced by a rise in postsynaptic Ca 2+ and was expressed as a reduction in presynaptic GABA release. An antagonist (AM251) of the type-1 cannabinoid receptor blocked the depolarization-induced suppression of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs), and the cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 reduced eIPSC amplitude and occluded suppression. The degree of WIN55,212-2-mediated inhibition of eIPSCs was strongly correlated with the magnitude of depolarization-induced suppression of the eIPSCs, suggesting that the WIN-sensitive afferents are suppressed by PN depolarization. Moreover, blocking endocannabinoid uptake with AM404 strongly modulated the kinetics and magnitude of eIPSC suppression. We conclude that the release of endocannabinoids from PNs allows for the postsynaptic control of presynaptic inhibition and could have profound consequences for the integrative properties of neocortical PNs.},

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in the regulation of glial activity and influences the progression of age-related learning and memory deficits. Mice lacking the Cnr1 gene (Cnr1 -/-), which encodes the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), showed an accelerated age-dependent deficit in spatial learning accompanied by a loss of principal neurons in the hippocampus. The age-dependent decrease in neuronal numbers in Cnr1 -/- mice was not related to decreased neurogenesis or to epileptic seizures. However, enhanced neuroinflammation characterized by an increased density of astrocytes and activated microglia as well as an enhanced expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 during aging was present in the hippocampus of Cnr1 -/- mice. The ongoing process of pyramidal cell degeneration and neuroinflammation can exacerbate each other and both contribute to the cognitive deficits. Deletion of CB1 receptors from the forebrain GABAergic, but not from the glutamatergic neurons, led to a similar neuronal loss and increased neuroinflammation in the hippocampus as observed in animals lacking CB1 receptors in all cells. Our results suggest that CB1 receptor activity on hippocampal GABAergic neurons protects against age-dependent cognitive decline by reducing pyramidal cell degeneration and neuroinflammation.},

The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is expressed in different neuronal subpopulations, and is engaged in fine-tuning excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Studies using conditional knock-out mice revealed necessary roles of CB1 receptor expressed in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons in synaptic plasticity and behavior, but whether this expression is also sufficient for brain functions is still to be determined. We applied a genetic strategy to reconstitute full wild-type CB1 receptor functions exclusively in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons and investigated endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic processes and behavior. Using this approach, we partly restored the phenotype of global CB1 receptor deletion in anxiety-like behaviors and fully restored hippocampus-dependent neuroprotection from chemically induced epileptiform seizures. These features coincided with a rescued hippocampal depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a CB1 receptor-dependent form of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic neurons. By comparison, the rescue of the CB1 receptor on dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons prolonged the time course of DSE in the amygdala, and impaired fear extinction in auditory fear conditioning. These data reveal that CB1 receptor in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons plays a sufficient role to control neuronal functions that are in large part hippocampus-dependent, while it is insufficient for proper amygdala functions, suggesting an unexpectedly complex circuit regulation by endocannabinoid signaling in the amygdala. Our data pave the way to a better understanding of neuronal networks in the context of behavior, by fine-tuned interference with synaptic transmission processes. © 2013 the authors.},

The pharmacological blockade of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been shown to reduce body weight and to alleviate obesity-related metabolic disorders. An unsolved question is at which anatomical level CB1 modulates energy balance and the mechanisms involved in its action. Here, we demonstrate that CB1 receptors expressed in forebrain and sympathetic neurons play a key role in the pathophysiological development of diet-induced obesity. Conditional mutant mice lacking CB1 expression in neurons known to control energy balance, but not in nonneuronal peripheral organs, displayed a lean phenotype and resistance to diet-induced obesity. This phenotype results from an increase in lipid oxidation and thermogenesis as a consequence of an enhanced sympathetic tone and a decrease in energy absorption.

   abstract = {Stress affects a constellation of physiological systems in the body and evokes a rapid shift in many neurobehavioral processes. A growing body of work indicates that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is an integral regulator of the stress response. In the current review, we discuss the evidence to date that demonstrates stress-induced regulation of eCB signaling and the consequential role changes in eCB signaling have with respect to many of the effects of stress. Across a wide array of stress paradigms, studies have generally shown that stress evokes bidirectional changes in the two eCB molecules, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), with stress exposure reducing AEA levels and increasing 2-AG levels. Additionally, in almost every brain region examined, exposure to chronic stress reliably causes a downregulation or loss of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. With respect to the functional role of changes in eCB signaling during stress, studies have demonstrated that the decline in AEA appears to contribute to the manifestation of the stress response, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increases in anxiety behavior, while the increased 2-AG signaling contributes to termination and adaptation of the HPA axis, as well as potentially contributing to changes in pain perception, memory and synaptic plasticity. More so, translational studies have shown that eCB signaling in humans regulates many of the same domains and appears to be a critical component of stress regulation, and impairments in this system may be involved in the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric conditions, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Collectively, these data create a compelling argument that eCB signaling is an important regulatory system in the brain that largely functions to buffer against many of the effects of stress and that dynamic changes in this system contribute to different aspects of the stress response.},

   abstract = {Acquisition and storage of aversive memories is one of the basic principles of central nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom. In the absence of reinforcement, the resulting behavioural response will gradually diminish to be finally extinct. Despite the importance of extinction, its cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and endocannabinoids are present in memory-related brain areas and modulate memory. Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a central function in extinction of aversive memories. CB1-deficient mice showed strongly impaired short-term and long-term extinction in auditory fear-conditioning tests, with unaffected memory acquisition and consolidation. Treatment of wild-type mice with the CB1 antagonist SR 141716A mimicked the phenotype of CB1-deficient mice, revealing that CB1 is required at the moment of memory extinction. Consistently, tone presentation during extinction trials resulted in elevated levels of endocannabinoids in the basolateral amygdala complex, a region known to control extinction of aversive memories. In the basolateral amygdala, endocannabinoids and CB1 were crucially involved in long-term depression of GABA γ-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory currents. We propose that endocannabinoids facilitate extinction of aversive memories through their selective inhibitory effects on local inhibitory networks in the amygdala.},

Then, we will argue how different specific biological functions of the CB1 receptor in the body converge to provide physiological exostatic processes. Finally, we will introduce the concept of proactive evolution-induced diseases (PEIDs), which helps explain the seeming paradox that an evolutionary-selected physiological function can become the cause of epidemic pathological conditions, such as obesity.

This article gives a basic overview of endocannabinoid neuroanatomy and function. Several endocannabinoids have been discovered to date, and their roles are being elucidated. Two G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R, have been identified, although other candidate receptors exist, including ion channel and nuclear receptors that might be components of the endocannabinoid system. It appears that cannabinoids are dysregulated in a number of psychiatric disorders and might be involved in their pathogenesis.

In addition, MPP stimulation at 10 Hz for 10 min triggered CB1 receptor-dependent excitatory long-term depression (eCB-eLTD) at MPP synapses of wild-type mice but not on CB1-knockout mice. This eCB-eLTD was group I mGluR-dependent, required intracellular calcium influx and 2-arachydonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) synthesis but did not depend on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Overall, these results point to a functional role for CB1 receptors with eCB-eLTD at DML MPP synapses and further involve these receptors in memory processing within the adult brain.},

   abstract = {Evidence indicates that blockade of cannabinoid receptors increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in brain cortical regions. Although it is assumed that this type of effect is mediated through CB1 receptor (CB 1R) antagonism, several in vitro functional studies recently have suggested non-CB1R involvement. In addition, neither the precise neuroanatomical site nor the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are known. We thoroughly examined these issues using a combination of systemic and local administration of CB1R antagonists, different methods of in vivo microdialysis, CB1R knockout (KO) mice, tissue measurements of ACh, and immunochemistry. First, we showed that systemic injections of the CB 1R antagonists N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4- dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride (SR-141716A) and N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H- pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) dose-dependently increased hippocampal ACh efflux. Likewise, local hippocampal, but not septal, infusions of SR141716A or AM251 increased hippocampal ACh release. It is noteworthy that the stimulatory effects of systemically administered CB1R antagonists on hippocampal ACh release were completely abolished in CB1R KO mice. CB 1R KO mice had similar basal but higher stress-enhanced hippocampal ACh levels compared with wild-type controls. It is interesting that dopamine D1 receptor antagonism counteracted the stimulatory effect of CB 1R blockade on hippocampal ACh levels. Finally, immunohistochemical methods revealed that a high proportion of CB1R-positive nerve terminals were found in hippocampus and confirmed the colocalization of CB 1 receptors with cholinergic and dopaminergic nerve terminals. In conclusion, hippocampal ACh release may specifically be controlled through CB1Rs located on both cholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal projections, and CB1R antagonism increases hippocampal ACh release, probably through both a direct disinhibition of ACh release and an indirect increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission at the D1 receptors.

   abstract = {Interneurons of the dentate gyrus are a diverse group of neurons that use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter. Morphological studies of these neurons have been challenging since no single neuroanatomical method provides a complete view of these interneurons. However, through the integration of findings obtained from multiple methods, an interesting picture of this complex group of neurons is emerging, and this review focuses on studies in rats and mice. In situ hybridization of mRNAs for the two isoforms of the GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67), demonstrates the abundance of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus and their high concentration in the hilus and along the base of the granule cell layer. Likewise, immunohistochemical studies, particularly of GAD65, demonstrate the rich fields of GABA terminals not only around the somata of granule cells but also in the dendritic regions of the molecular layer. This broad group of GABA neurons and their terminals can be subdivided according to their morphological characteristics, including the distribution of their axonal plexus, and their neurochemical identity. Intracellular labeling of single interneurons has been instrumental in demonstrating the extensiveness of their axonal plexus and the relatively specific spatial distribution of their axonal fields. These findings have led to the broad classification of interneurons into those that terminate primarily at perisomatic regions and those that innervate the dendrites of granule cells. The interneurons also can be classified according to their neuropeptide and calcium-binding protein content. These and other molecules contribute to the rich diversity of dentate interneurons and may provide opportunities for selectively regulating specific groups of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus in order to enhance their function or protect vulnerable neurons from damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is also found in humans at a considerable level and appears to contribute significantly to hippocampal plasticity across the life span, because it is regulated by activity. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis generates new excitatory granule cells in the dentate gyrus, whose axons form the mossy fiber tract that links the dentate gyrus to CA3. It originates from a population of radial glia-like precursor cells (type 1 cells) that have astrocytic properties, express markers of neural stem cells and divide rarely. They give rise to intermediate progenitor cells with first glial (type 2a) and then neuronal (type 2b) phenotype. Through a migratory neuroblast-like stage (type 3), the newborn, lineage-committed cells exit the cell cycle and enter a maturation stage, during which they extend their dendrites into a the molecular layer and their axon to CA3. They go through a period of several weeks, during which they show increased synaptic plasticity, before finally becoming indistinguishable from the older granule cells.},

Here, we report that axons of SuM neurons make monosynaptic connections to granule cells (GCs) and GABAergic interneurons, but not to hilar mossy cells, in the DG and co-release glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at these synapses. Although inputs from the SuM can excite some interneurons, the inputs alone fail to generate spikes in GCs. However, despite the insufficient excitatory drive and GABAergic co-transmission, SuM inputs have net excitatory effects on GCs and can potentiate GC firing when temporally associated with perforant path inputs. Our results indicate that the SuM influences DG information processing by modulating GC outputs. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-to-hippocampus network is implicated in spatial and emotional memory formation, but little is known about precise neural connections.

Here we describe GABAB 1a/b receptor (GABABR) and type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) expression in rat septal cholinergic [i.e. choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive] cells. Using double immunofluorescent staining, we found that almost two-thirds of the cholinergic cells in the rat medial septum were GABABR positive, and that these cells had significantly larger somata than did GABABR-negative cholinergic neurons. We detected CB1R labelling in somata after axonal protein transport was blocked by colchicine. In these animals about one-third of the cholinergic cells were CB1R positive. These cells again had larger somata than CB1R-negative cholinergic neurons. The analyses confirmed that the size of GABABR-positive and CB 1R-positive cholinergic cells were alike, and all CB 1R-positive cholinergic cells were GABABR positive as well. CB1R-positive cells were invariably ChAT positive. All retrogradely labelled septohippocampal cholinergic cells were positive for GABABR and at least half of them also for CB1R. These data shed light on the existence of at least two cholinergic cell types in the medial septum: one expresses GABABR and CB1R, has large somata and projects to the hippocampus, whereas the other is negative for GABABR and CB1R and has smaller somata. The results also suggest that cholinergic transmission in the hippocampus is fine-tuned by endocannabinoid signalling. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.},

In order to substantiate the physiological role of the CB1 receptor in serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei, we generated serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuron-specific CB1 receptor-deficient mice, using the Cre/loxP system with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the regulatory sequences of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2-CreERT2), thus, restricting the recombination to 5-HT neurons of the central nervous system (CNS).

   abstract = {Cannabinoids can modulate motor behaviour, learning and memory, cognition and pain perception. These effects correlate with the expression of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and with the presence of endogenous cannabinoids in the brain. In trying to obtain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the modulatory effects of cannabinoids, CB1-positive neurons were determined in the murine forebrain at a single cell resolution. We performed a double in situ hybridization study to detect mRNA of CB1 in combination with mRNA of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65k, neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), parvalbumin, calretinin and calbindin D28k, respectively. Our results revealed that CB1-expressing cells can be divided into distinct neuronal subpopulations. There is a clear distinction between neurons containing CB1 mRNA either at high levels or low levels. The majority of high CB1-expressing cells are GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurons belonging mainly to the cholecystokinin-positive and parvalbumin-negative type of interneurons (basket cells) and, to a lower extent, to the calbindin D28k-positive mid-proximal dendritic inhibitory interneurons. Only a fraction of low CBI-expressing cells is GABAergic. In the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex area, CB1 mRNA is present at low but significant levels in many non-GABAergic cells that can be considered as projecting principal neurons. Thus, a complex mechanism appears to underlie the modulatory effects of cannabinoids. They might act on principal glutamatergic circuits as well as modulate local GABAergic inhibitory circuits. CB1 is very highly coexpressed with CCK. It is known that cannabinoids and CCK often have opposite effects on behaviour and physiology. Therefore, we suggest that a putative cross-talk between cannabinoids and CCK might exist and will be relevant to better understanding of physiology and pharmacology of the cannabinoid system.},

In an effort to elucidate whether cannabinoid (CB1) receptors are positioned to presynaptically modulate norepinephrine release in the frontal cortex, immunocytochemical detection of the CB1 receptor and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) was performed using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy in rat brain. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of dually labeled tissue sections from the frontal cortex indicated that individual axonal processes exhibited both CB1 receptor and DβH immunoreactivities. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that one-third of axon terminals containing CB1 immunolabeling also exhibited DβH labeling. Cortical neurons were also found to be targeted by separately labeled CB1- and DβH-containing axon terminals. In conclusion, the present neuroanatomical data suggest that cortical norepinephrine release may be modulated, in part, by CB1 receptors that are presynaptically distributed on noradrenergic axon terminals. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Cellular activity in the brain depends on the high energetic support provided by mitochondria, the cell organelles which use energy sources to generate ATP. Acute cannabinoid intoxication induces amnesia in humans and animals, and the activation of type-1 cannabinoid receptors present at brain mitochondria membranes (mtCB 1) can directly alter mitochondrial energetic activity. Although the pathological impact of chronic mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain is well established, the involvement of acute modulation of mitochondrial activity in high brain functions, including learning and memory, is unknown. Here, we show that acute cannabinoid-induced memory impairment in mice requires activation of hippocampal mtCB 1 receptors. Genetic exclusion of CB 1 receptors from hippocampal mitochondria prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of mitochondrial mobility, synaptic transmission and memory formation. mtCB 1 receptors signal through intra-mitochondrial Gα i protein activation and consequent inhibition of soluble-adenylyl cyclase (sAC). The resulting inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport system eventually leads to decreased cellular respiration. Hippocampal inhibition of sAC activity or manipulation of intra-mitochondrial PKA signalling or phosphorylation of the Complex I subunit NDUFS2 inhibit bioenergetic and amnesic effects of cannabinoids. Thus, the G protein-coupled mtCB 1 receptors regulate memory processes via modulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism. By directly linking mitochondrial activity to memory formation, these data reveal that bioenergetic processes are primary acute regulators of cognitive functions.},

Through activation of mtCB 1 receptors, exogenous cannabinoids and in situ endocannabinoids decreased cyclic AMP concentration, protein kinase A activity, complex I enzymatic activity and respiration in neuronal mitochondria.

Stimulation of the PP evoked both field potentials and single unit discharges in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that the CA1 response does not involve granule or CA3 neurons: (i) movement of the recording electrode in the CA1 region away from the site of stimulation in the PP and closer to the CA3 region increased the latency of the evoked potential; (ii) the sum of the latencies of the indivdual pathways in a trisynaptic circuit - from the PP to granule cells to CA3 neurons to CA1 neurons - was 2-3 times longer than the latency of the PP evoked response recorded in the CA1 region; (iii) lesioning the mossy fiber pathway or excising the CA3 region did not inhibit the CA1 response to PP stimulation. Other experimental results suggest that the PP activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons involves a direct synaptic pathway: (i) PP stimulation evoked potentials with similar latencies in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region; (ii) the CA1 response was abolished in a Krebs' solution containing low calcium/high magnesium; (iii) excising a portion of the CA1 region between the stimulating electrode in the PP and the CA1 recording electrode, but sparing the PP, did not abolish the CA1 response; (iv) electrolytic lesions of the PP abolished the CA1 response to PP stimulation, but did not affect the CA1 response to stimulation of the CA3 region. The data suggest that fibers in the PP make direct synaptic connection with pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. © 1982.},

   abstract = {For the past 3 decades, functional characterizations of the hippocampus have emphasized its intrinsic trisynaptic circuitry, which consists of successive excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, from granule cells of the dentate to the CA3/4 pyramidal cell region, and from CA3/4 to the CA1/2 pyramidal cell region. Despite unequivocal anatomical evidence for a monosynaptic projection from entorhinal to CA3 and CA1/2, few in vivo electrophysiological studies of the direct pathway have been reported. In the experiments presented here, we stimulated axons of entorhinal cortical neurons in vivo and recorded evoked single unit and population spike responses in the dentate, CA3, and CA1 of hippocampus, to determine if pyramidal cells are driven primarily via the monosynaptic or trisynaptic pathways. Our results show that neurons within the three subfields of the hippocampus discharge simultaneously in response to input from a given subpopulation of entorhinal cortical neurons and that the initial monosynaptic excitation of pyramidal cells then is followed by weaker excitatory volleys transmitted through the trisynaptic pathway. In addition, we found that responses of CA3 pyramidal cells often precede those of dentate granule cells and that excitation of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells can occur in the absence of granule cell excitation. In total, these results argue for a different conceptualization of the functional organization of the hippocampus with respect to the propagation of activity through its intrinsic pathways: input from the entorhinal cortex initiates a two-phase feedforward excitation of pyramidal cells, with the dentate gyrus providing feedforward excitation of CA3, and with both the dentate and CA3 providing feedforward excitation of CA1.},

Only recent work points to the crucial role of inhibitory interneurons in regulating the com-plex interactions among principal cells, including population oscillations, plasticity, epileptic synchronization, hormonal effects, and cortical devel-opment. Perhaps the best illustration of this point is the pivotal role in-terneurons play in population oscillations (theta, gamma, 200-Hz ripples) and memory-related plasticity in the hippocampal formation. The very ba-sics of neuronal cooperation is a subject of intensive research (" integrate-and-fire " vs. coincidence detectors; rhythmic vs. stochastic activity; Gernstein and Mandelbrot, 1964; Shadlen and Newsome, 1994; Softky, 1995). Even if a complete identification of the molecular and biophysical properties of single cells eventually becomes possible, such knowledge is insufficient to predict the behavior of large neuronal aggregates in com-plex integrative areas of the brain, such as the hippocampal formation. Population interactions of neuronal ensembles underlying behavioral con-trol cannot be revealed without a comprehensive understanding of the di-alogue between interneuronal networks and principal cell populations. It has been known for over 100 years (Ram6n y Cajal, 1893, 191 1) that neurons constituting any cortical area are far from being uniform with re-gard to their morphology and connectivity, suggesting that they possess the capacity to interact with each other in a complex and diverse fashion. Descriptions of increasing numbers of cell types with distinct dendritic morphology and axonal targets result in a multitude of possible interac-tions.

@article{Amaral1989,
   abstract = {In the early 1970s, Andersen and colleagues proposed that the principal excitatory pathways of the hippocampal formation were organized in a lamellar fashion. This proposition, based heavily on the physiological studies of the proponents, indicated that "a point source of entorhinal activity projects its impulses through the four membered pathway (of the hippocampal formation) along a slice or lamella, of hippocampal tissue oriented normally to the alvear surface" [Anderson P., Bliss V. P. and Skrede K. K. (1971) Expl Brain Res. 13, 222-238] and perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Andersen et al. further suggested that, "By means of this lamellar organization, small strips of the hippocampal cortex may operate as independent functional units, although excitatory and inhibitory transverse connections may modify the behavior of neighboring lamellae.". The "lamellar hypothesis" of hippocampal anatomical organization has had tremendous influence on the conceptualization of hippocampal information processing and was largely responsible for prompting the establishment of the in vitro hippocampal slice technology. While the "lamellar hypothesis" was consistent with the known neuroanatomy, subsequent neuroanatomical investigations, using a variety of modern tracing techniques, have invariably demonstrated that all of the major hippocampal projections, except for those arising from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, are much more divergent than would be consistent with a strict interpretation of the lamellar hypothesis. This has become particularly clear in ongoing studies of the intrinsic hippocampal projections using the recently introduced anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Citing the conclusions from several papers dealing with the anatomical organization of the hippocampal formation and using examples from recent Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin mapping studies, the following are demonstrated. 1. (1) That the major hippocampal projections are as extensive and highly organized in the long or septotemporal axis of the hippocampus as in the transverse axis. 2. (2) That at least some of the hippocampal projections, such as the associational projections arising from the dentate gyrus, appear to be specifically organized to integrate distant levels of the hippocampal formation. 3. (3) That the physiological data of Anderson et al. can be re-interpreted in the light of these new anatomical data to show how the stimulation and recording protocols used at the time would, in fact, generate the appearance of a lamellar organization. It is concluded that it is heuristically most reasonable to consider the hippocampal formation as a three-dimensional cortical region with important information processing taking place in both the transverse and long axes. This view of intrinsic hippocampal circuitry may be important for the interpretation of physiological studies of the rat hippocampus and for efforts directed at developing models of hippocampal function. © 1989.},

Moreover, a foundation of knowledge regarding the function of hippocampal circuits, and its role in supporting synaptic plasticity has facilitated our understanding of the roles cannabinoids play in the diverse behaviors in which the hippocampus participates, in both normal and pathological states. In this review, we present an historical overview of research pertaining to the hippocampal cannabinoid system to provide context in which to understand the participation of the hippocampus in cognition, behavior, and epilepsy. We also examine potential roles for the hippocampal formation in mediating dysfunctional behavior, and assert that these phenomena reflect disordered physiological activity within the hippocampus and its interactions with other brain regions after exposure to synthetic cannabinoids, and the phytocannabinoids found in marijuana, such as Δ9-THC and cannabidiol. In this regard, we examine contemporary hypotheses concerning the hippocampal endocannabinoid system's participation in psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, and examine cannabinoid-sensitive cellular mechanisms contributing to coherent network oscillations as potential contributors to these disorders.

Other sites that were also clearly labelled could not be assigned as logical sources of cannabinoid receptors.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids work as retrograde messengers and contribute to short-term and long-term modulation of synaptic transmission via presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. It is generally accepted that the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) mediates the effects of endocannabinoid in inhibitory synapses. For excitatory synapses, however, contributions of CB1, "CB3," and some other unidentified receptors have been suggested. In the present study we used electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques and examined the type(s) of cannabinoid receptor functioning at hippocampal and cerebellar excitatory synapses. Our electrophysiological data clearly demonstrate the predominant contribution of CB1. At hippocampal excitatory synapses on pyramidal neurons the cannabinoid-induced synaptic suppression was reversed by a CB1-specific antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl- 1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251), and was absent in CB1 knock-out mice. At climbing fiber (CF) and parallel fiber (PF) synapses on cerebellar Purkinje cells the cannabinoid-dependent suppression was absent in CB1 knock-out mice. The presence of CB1 at presynaptic terminals was confirmed by immunohistochemical experiments with specific antibodies against CB1. In immunoelectron microscopy the densities of CB1-positive signals in hippocampal excitatory terminals and cerebellar PF terminals were much lower than in inhibitory terminals but were clearly higher than the background. Along the long axis of PFs, the CB1 was localized at a much higher density on the perisynaptic membrane than on the extrasynaptic and synaptic regions. In contrast, CB1 density was low in CF terminals and was not significantly higher than the background. Despite the discrepancy between the electrophysiological and morphological data for CB1 expression on CFs, these results collectively indicate that CB1 is responsible for cannabinoid-dependent suppression of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus and cerebellum.

Over the past decade, many key players in 2-AG synthesis and degradation have been identified and characterized. Most 2-AG is synthesized from membrane phospholipids via sequential activation of a phospholipase Cβ and a diacylglycerol lipase, although other pathways may contribute in specialized settings. 2-AG breakdown is more complicated with at least eight different enzymes participating. These enzymes can either degrade 2-AG into its components, arachidonic acid and glycerol, or transform 2-AG into highly bioactive signal molecules. The implications of the precise temporal and spatial control of the expression and function of these pleiotropic metabolizing enzymes have only recently come to be appreciated. In this review, we will focus on the primary organization of the synthetic and degradative pathways of 2-AG and then discuss more recent findings and their implications, with an eye towards the biological and therapeutic implications of manipulating 2-AG synthesis and metabolism.

   abstract = {We investigated the transduction mechanisms mediating formation of the endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) lipids, anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide) and 2-arachidonylglycerol, in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. Unstimulated neurons contained 0.3 ± 0.1 pmol of anandamide and 16.5 ± 3.3 pmol of 2-arachidonylglycerol per mg of protein, as determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Ca2+ entry into the neurons via activated glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors increased 2-arachidonylglycerol levels approximately three times, but had no effect on anandamide levels. By contrast, anandamide formation was stimulated five times by simultaneous activation of NMDA and acetylcholine receptors. Alone, acetylcholine receptor activation had no effect on anandamide or 2-arachidonylglycerol levels. The formation of fatty acid ethanolamides that do not activate cannabinoid receptors, including palmitylethanolamide and oleylethanolamide, was stimulated by coactivation of NMDA and acetylcholine receptors. Pharmacological experiments suggest that the cholinergic contribution to anandamide formation was mediated by α7 nicotinic receptors (antagonized by methyllycaconitine), whereas the contribution to palmitylethanolamide and oleylethanolamide formation was mediated by muscarinic receptors (antagonized by atropine). These findings indicate that cortical neurons produce anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol in a receptor-dependent manner, and that brain neurons may generate different endocannabinoid lipids depending on their complement of neurotransmitter receptors. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we show that a distinct pathway exists in brain, where monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol to generate a major arachidonate precursor pool for neuroinflammatory prostaglandins. MAGL-disrupted animals show neuroprotection in a parkinsonian mouse model. These animals are spared the hemorrhaging caused by COX inhibitors in the gut, where prostaglandins are instead regulated by cytosolic PLA2. These findings identify MAGL as a distinct metabolic node that couples endocannabinoid to prostaglandin signaling networks in the nervous system and suggest that inhibition of this enzyme may be a new and potentially safer way to suppress the proinflammatory cascades that underlie neurodegenerative disorders.},

Here we show that the vasodilator response to anandamide in isolated arteries is capsaicin-sensitive and accompanied by release of calcitonin- gene-related peptide (CGRP). The selective CGRP-receptor antagonist 8-37 CGRP (ref. 5), but not the cannabinoid CB1 receptor blocker SR141716A (ref. 7), inhibited the vasodilator effect of anandamide. Other endogenous. (2- arachidonylglycerol, palmitylethanolamide) and synthetic (HU 210, WIN 55,212- 2, CP 55,940) CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists could not mimic the action of anandamide. The selective 'vanilloid receptor' antagonist capsazepine inhibited anandamide-induced vasodilation and release of CGRP. In patch-clamp experiments on cells expressing the cloned vanilloid receptor (VR1), anandamide induced a capsazepine-sensitive current in whole cells and isolated membrane patches. Our results indicate that anandamide induces vasodilation by activating vanilloid receptors on perivascular sensory nerves and causing release of CGRP. The vanilloid receptor may thus be another molecular target for endogenous anandamide, besides cannabinoid receptors, in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.},

Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are regarded as two major endocannabinoids. To determine to what extent 2-AG contributes to retrograde signaling, we generated and analyzed mutant mice lacking either of the two 2-AG synthesizing enzymes diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) and β (DGLβ). We found that endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic suppression was totally absent in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum of DGLα knockout mice, whereas the retrograde suppression was intact in DGLβ knockout brains. The basal 2-AG content was markedly reduced and stimulus-induced elevation of 2-AG was absent in DGLα knockout brains, whereas the 2-AG content was normal in DGLβ knockout brains. Morphology of the brain and expression of molecules required for 2-AG production other than DGLs were normal in the two knockout mice. We conclude that 2-AG produced by DGLα, but not by DGLβ, mediates retrograde suppression at central synapses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Indeed, anandamide induced triglyceride droplet accumulation and the expression of PPARγ responsive genes such as CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (C-EBPα), aP2, PerilipinA and Acrp30. Furthermore, the PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) inhibited the anandamide-induced 3T3-L1 differentiation confirming that this is a PPARγ-mediated process.

We investigated their ultrastructural distribution in brain areas where the localization and effects of cannabinoid receptor activation are known. In the hippocampus, FAAH was present in somata and dendrites of principal cells, but not in interneurons. It was located mostly on the membrane surface of intracellular organelles known to store Ca2+ (e.g. mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum), less frequently on the somatic or dendritic plasma membrane. MGL immunoreactivity was found in axon terminals of granule cells, CA3 pyramidal cells and some interneurons. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells and their dendrites are intensively immunoreactive for FAAH, together with a sparse axon plexus at the border of the Purkinje cell/granule cell layers. Immunostaining for MGL was complementary, the axons in the molecular layer were intensively labelled leaving the Purkinje cell dendrites blank. FAAH distribution in the amygdala was similar to that of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor: evident signal in neuronal somata and proximal dendrites in the basolateral nucleus, and hardly any labelling in the central nucleus. MGL staining was restricted to axons in the neuropil, with similar relative signal intensities seen for FAAH in different nuclei. Thus, FAAH is primarily a postsynaptic enzyme, whereas MGL is presynaptic. FAAH is associated with membranes of cytoplasmic organelles. The differential compartmentalization of the two enzymes suggests that anandamide and 2-AG signalling may subserve functional roles that are spatially segregated at least at the stage of metabolism.},

   abstract = {Background: The endocannabinoid system functions through two well characterized receptor systems, the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. Work by a number of groups in recent years has provided evidence that the system is more complicated and additional receptor types should exist to explain ligand activity in a number of physiological processes. Experimental approach: Cells transfected with the human cDNA for GPR55 were tested for their ability to bind and to mediate GTPγS binding by cannabinoid ligands. Using an antibody and peptide blocking approach, the nature of the G-protein coupling was determined and further demonstrated by measuring activity of downstream signalling pathways. Key results: We demonstrate that GPR55 binds to and is activated by the cannabinoid ligand CP55940. In addition endocannabinoids including anandamide and virodhamine activate GTPγS binding via GPR55 with nM potencies. Ligands such as cannabidiol and abnormal cannabidiol which exhibit no CB 1or CB 2 activity and are believed to function at a novel cannabinoid receptor, also showed activity at GPR55. GPR55 couples to Gα13 and can mediate activation of rhoA, cdc42 and rac1. Conclusions: These data suggest that GPR55 is a novel cannabinoid receptor, and its ligand profile with respect to CB 1 and CB 2 described here will permit delineation of its physiological function(s). © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {2-Arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) is an endocannabinoid that is released from postsynaptic neurons, acts retrogradely on presynaptic cannabinoid receptor CB1, and induces short- and long-term suppression of transmitter release. To understand the mechanisms of the 2-AG-mediated retrograde modulation, we investigated subcellular localization of a major 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme, diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGLα), by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse brain. In the cerebellum, DAGLα was predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells. DAGLα was detected on the dendritic surface and occasionally on the somatic surface, with a distal-to-proximal gradient from spiny branchlets toward somata. DAGLα was highly concentrated at the base of spine neck and also accumulated with much lower density on somatodendritic membrane around the spine neck. However, DAGLα was excluded from the main body of spine neck and head. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, DAGLα was also accumulated in spines. In contrast to the distribution in Purkinje cells, DAGLα was distributed in the spine head, neck, or both, whereas somatodendritic membrane was labeled very weakly. These results indicate that DAGLα is essentially targeted to postsynaptic spines in cerebellar and hippocampal neurons, but its fine distribution within and around spines is differently regulated between the two neurons. The preferential spine targeting should enable efficient 2-AG production on excitatory synaptic activity and its swift retrograde modulation onto nearby presynaptic terminals expressing CB1. Furthermore, different fine localization within and around spines suggests that the distance between postsynaptic 2-AG production site and presynaptic CB1 is differentially controlled depending on neuron types.

Despite this, the classification of GPR55 as a cannabinoid receptor remains a contentious issue. The weight of evidence points to GPR55 as a receptor that is activated by certain cannabinoid ligands and by the bioactive lipid l-α-lysophosphatidylinsoitol. It couples to G12 proteins, activates RhoA and mobilizes intracellular Ca2+, possibly in an agonist- and tissue-dependant manner, thus displaying 'agonist functional selectivity'.

   abstract = {Neocortical GABA-containing interneurons form complex functional networks responsible for feedforward and feedback inhibition and for the generation of cortical oscillations associated with several behavioural functions. We previously reported that fast-spiking (FS), but not low-threshold-spiking (LTS), neocortical interneurons from rats generate a fast and precise self-inhibition mediated by inhibitory autaptic transmission. Here we show that LTS cells possess a different form of self-inhibition. LTS, but not FS, interneurons undergo a prominent hyperpolarization mediated by an increased K +-channel conductance. This self-induced inhibition lasts for many minutes, is dependent on an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and is blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251, indicating that it is mediated by the autocrine release of endogenous cannabinoids. Endocannabinoid-mediated slow self-inhibition represents a powerful and long-lasting mechanism that alters the intrinsic excitability of LTS neurons, which selectively target the major site of excitatory connections onto pyramidal neurons; that is, their dendrites. Thus, modulation of LTS networks after their sustained firing will lead to long-lasting changes of glutamate-mediated synaptic strength in pyramidal neurons, with consequences during normal and pathophysiological cortical network activities.},

Although there is evidence that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) mediates this process, the molecular mechanism underlying 2-AG mobilization remains unclear. In the present study, we used a combination of genetic and targeted lipidomic approaches to investigate the role of the postsynaptic membrane-associated lipase, diacylglycerol lipase type-α (DGL-α), in mGlu receptor-dependent 2-AG mobilization. DGL-α overexpression in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells increased baseline 2-AG levels. This effect was accompanied by enhanced utilization of the 2-AG precursor 1-stearoyl,2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and increased accumulation of the 2-AG breakdown product arachidonic acid. A similar, albeit less marked response was observed with other unsaturated and polyunsaturated monoacylglycerols, 1,2-diacylglycerols, and fatty acids. Silencing of DGL-α by RNA interference elicited lipidomic changes opposite those of DGL-α overexpression and abolished group I mGlu receptor-dependent 2-AG mobilization. Coimmunoprecipitation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that DGL-α interacts, via a PPxxF domain, with the coiled-coil (CC)-Homer proteins Homer-1b and Homer-2, two components of the molecular scaffold that enables group I mGlu signaling. DGL-α mutants that do not bind Homer maintained their ability to generate 2-AG in intact cells but failed to associate with the plasma membrane. The findings indicate that DGL-α mediates group I mGlu receptor-induced 2-AG mobilization. They further suggest that the interaction of CC-Homer with DGL-α is necessary for appropriate function of this lipase.

   abstract = {Cannabinoids act at two classical cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 and CB 2), a 7TM orphan receptor and the transmitter-gated channel transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 receptor. Recent evidence also points to cannabinoids acting at members of the nuclear receptor family, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, with three subtypes α, β (δ) and γ), which regulate cell differentiation and lipid metabolism. Much evidence now suggests that endocannabinoids are natural activators of PPARα. Oleoylethanolamide regulates feeding and body weight, stimulates fat utilization and has neuroprotective effects mediated through activation of PPARα. Similarly, palmitoylethanolamide regulates feeding and lipid metabolism and has anti-inflammatory properties mediated by PPARα. Other endocannabinoids that activate PPARα include anandamide, virodhamine and noladin. Some (but not all) endocannabinoids also activate PPARγ; anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol have anti-inflammatory properties mediated by PPARγ. Similarly, ajulemic acid, a structural analogue of a metabolite of Δ 9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes anti-inflammatory effects in vivo through PPARγ. THC also activates PPARγ, leading to a time-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated arteries. Other cannabinoids which activate PPARγ include N-arachidonoyl-dopamine, HU210, WIN55212-2 and CP55940. In contrast, little research has been carried out on the effects of cannabinoids at PPARδ. In this newly emerging area, a number of research questions remain unanswered; for example, why do cannabinoids activate some isoforms and not others? How much of the chronic effects of cannabinoids are through activation of nuclear receptors? And importantly, do cannabinoids confer the same neuro- and cardioprotective benefits as other PPARα and PPARγ agonists? This review will summarize the published literature implicating cannabinoid-mediated PPAR effects and discuss the implications thereof. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

In addition, this review describes in vitro findings that suggest that the first eight of these compounds can activate CB1 and sometimes also CB2 receptors and that another two of these compounds are CB1 receptor antagonists (sphingosine) or antagonists/inverse agonists (haemopressin). Evi- dence for the existence of at least three allosteric endocannabinoids is also presented. These endogenous compounds appear to target allosteric sites on cannabinoid receptors in vitro, either as negative allosteric modulators of the CB1 receptor (pepcan-12 and pregnenolone) or as positive allosteric modulators of this receptor (lipoxin A4) or of the CB2 receptor (pepcan-12). Also discussed are current in vitro data that indicate the extent to which some established or putative orthosteric endocannabinoids seem to target non-cannabinoid receptors and ion channels, particularly at concentrations at which they have been found to interact with CB1 or CB2 receptors.},

Little is known on the possible molecular targets of this compound. We investigated whether CBD and some of its derivatives interact with vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1), the receptor for capsaicin, or with proteins that inactivate the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide (AEA). 2. CBD and its enantiomer, (+)-CBD, together with seven analogues, obtained by exchanging the C-7 methyl group of CBD with a hydroxy-methyl or a carboxyl function and/or the C-5′ pentyl group with a di-methyl-heptyl (DMH) group, were tested on: (a) VR1-mediated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in cells over-expressing human VR1; (b) [14C]-AEA uptake by RBL-2H3 cells, which is facilitated by a selective membrane transporter; and (c) [14C]-AEA hydrolysis by rat brain membranes, which is catalysed by the fatty acid amide hydrolase. 3. Both CBD and (+)-CBD, but not the other analogues, stimulated VR1 with EC50 = 3.2-3.5 μM, and with a maximal effect similar in efficacy to that of capsaicin, i.e. 67-70% of the effect obtained with ionomycin (4 μM). CBD (10 μM) desensitized VR1 to the action of capsaicin. The effects of maximal doses of the two compounds were not additive. 4. (+)-5′-DMH-CBD and (+)-7-hydroxy-5′-DMH-CBD inhibited [14C]-AEA uptake (IC50 = 10.0 and 7.0 μM); the (-)-enantiomers were slightly less active (IC50 = 14.0 and 12.5 μM). CBD and (+)-CBD were also active (IC50 = 22.0 and 17.0 μM). 5. CBD (IC50 = 27.5 μM), (+)-CBD (IC50 = 63.5 μM) and (-)-7-hydroxy-CBD (IC50 = 34 μM), but not the other analogues (IC50 > 100 μM), weakly inhibited [14C]-AEA hydrolysis. 6. Only the (+)-isomers exhibited high affinity for CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoid receptors. 7. These findings suggest that VR1 receptors, or increased levels of endogenous AEA, might mediate some of the pharmacological effects of CBD and its analogues. In view of the facile high yield synthesis, and the weak affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors, (-)-5′-DMH-CBD represents a valuable candidate for further investigation as inhibitor of AEA uptake and a possible new therapeutic agent.},

The Gαo protein is the most abundant Ga subtype in the nervous system, but it is also found in the heart. Its function is not completely known, although it is required for regulation of N-type Ca2+ channels in GH3 cells and also interacts with GAP43, a major protein in growth cones, suggesting a role in neuronal pathfinding. To analyze the function of Gαo, we have generated mice lacking both isoforms of Gαo by homologous recombination. Surprisingly, the nervous system is grossly intact, despite the fact that Gαo makes up 0.2-0.5% of brain particulate protein and 10% of the growth cone membrane. The Gαo-/- mice do suffer tremors and occasional seizures, but there is no obvious histologic abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, Gαo-/- mice have a clear and specific defect in ion channel regulation in the heart. Normal muscarinic regulation of L-type calcium channels in ventricular myocytes is absent in the mutant mice. The L-type calcium channel responds normally to isoproterenol, but there is no evident muscarinic inhibition. Muscarinic regulation of atrial K+ channels is normal, as is the electrocardiogram. The levels of other Gα subunits (Gαs, Gαq, and Gαi) are unchanged in the hearts of Gαo-/- mice, but the amount of Gβγ is decreased. Whichever subunit, Gαo or Gβγ, carries the signal forward, these studies show that muscarinic inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels requires coupling of the muscarinic receptor to Gαo. Other cardiac Gα subunits cannot substitute.},

   abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of age-related decline in plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. From four PMCA isoforms, PMCA2, and PMCA3 respond to a rapid removal of Ca2+ and are expressed predominantly in excitable cells. We have previously shown that suppression of neuron-specific PMCAs in differentiated PC12 cells accelerated cell differentiation, but increased apoptosis in PMCA2-deficient line. We also demonstrated that altered expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels correlated with their higher contribution to Ca2+ influx, which varied between PMCA-reduced lines. Here, we propose a mechanism unique for differentiated PC12 cells by which PMCA2 and PMCA3 regulate pGAP43/GAP43 ratio and the interaction between GAP43 and calmodulin (CaM). Although down-regulation of PMCA2 or PMCA3 altered the content of GAP43/pGAP43, of paramount importance for the regulatory mechanism is a disruption of isoform-specific inhibitory PMCA/calcineurin interaction. In result, higher endogenous calcineurin (CaN) activity leads to hypophosphorylation of GAP43 in PMCA2- or PMCA3-deficient lines and intensification of GAP43/CaM complex formation, thus potentially limiting the availability of free CaM. In overall, our results indicate that both “fast” PMCA isoforms could actively regulate the local CaN function and CaN-downstream processes. In connection with our previous observations, we also suggest a negative feedback of cooperative action of CaM, GAP43, and CaN on P/Q and L-type channels activity. PMCAs- and CaN-dependent mechanism presented here, may signify a protective action against calcium overload in neuronal cells during aging, as well a potential way for decreasing neuronal cells vulnerability to neurodegenerative insults.},

   abstract = {THE major active ingredient of marijuana, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabi-nol (Δ9-THC), has been used as a psychoactive agent for thousands of years. Marijuana, and Δ9-THC, also exert a wide range of other effects including analgesia, anti-inflammation, immunosuppression, anticonvulsion, alleviation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma, and attenuation of vomiting1. The clinical application of cannabinoids has, however, been limited by their psychoactive effects, and this has led to interest in the biochemical bases of their action. Progress stemmed initially from the synthesis of potent derivatives of δ9-THC4,5, and more recently from the cloning of a gene encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor for cannabinoids6. This receptor is expressed in the brain but not in the periphery, except for a low level in testes. It has been proposed that the non-psychoactive effects of cannabinoids are either mediated centrally or through direct interaction with other, non-receptor proteins1,7,8. Here we report the cloning of a receptor for cannabinoids that is not expressed in the brain but rather in macrophages in the marginal zone of spleen. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

The two CB 1 -agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure, relative to the antagonist-bound state, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G-protein-binding region. In addition, a Δ twin toggle switch' of Phe200 3.36 and Trp356 6.48 (superscripts denote Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering) is experimentally observed and appears to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB 1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9 -THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB 1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G-protein-coupled receptors.

Then, the discovery in 2001 that endocannabinoids mediate retrograde synaptic signaling has opened up a new era for cannabinoid research and also established a new concept how diffusible messengers modulate synaptic efficacy and neural activity. The last 7 years have witnessed remarkable advances in our understanding of the endocannabinoid system. It is now well accepted that endocannabinoids are released from postsynaptic neurons, activate presynaptic cannabinoid CB 1 receptors, and cause transient and long-lasting reduction of neurotransmitter release. In this review, we aim to integrate our current understanding of functions of the endocannabinoid system, especially focusing on the control of synaptic transmission in the brain. We summarize recent electrophysiological studies carried out on synapses of various brain regions and discuss how synaptic transmission is regulated by endocannabinoid signaling. Then we refer to recent anatomical studies on subcellular distribution of the molecules involved in endocannabinoid signaling and discuss how these signaling molecules are arranged around synapses. In addition, we make a brief overview of studies on cannabinoid receptors and their intracellular signaling, biochemical studies on endocannabinoid metabolism, and behavioral studies on the roles of the endocannabinoid system in various aspects of neural functions.},

However, anandamide and 2-AG, and also the phytocannabinoids, have more molecular targets than just CB1R and CB2R. Furthermore, the endocannabinoids, like most other lipid mediators, have more than just one set of biosynthetic and degrading pathways and enzymes, which they often share with “endocannabinoid-like” mediators that may or may not interact with the same proteins as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and other phytocannabinoids. In some cases, these degrading pathways and enzymes lead to molecules that are not inactive and instead interact with other receptors. Finally, some of the metabolic enzymes may also participate in the chemical modification of molecules that have very little to do with endocannabinoid and cannabinoid targets.

Although CNS depression and analgesia are well documented effects of the cannabinoids, the mechanisms responsible for these and other cannabinoid-induced effects are not so far known3. The hydrophobic nature of these substances has suggested that cannabinoids resemble anaesthetic agents in their action, that is, they nonspecifically disrupt cellular membranes. Recent evidence, however, has supported a mechanism involving a G protein-coupled receptor found in brain and neural cell lines, and which inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent, stereoselective and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner4-7. Also, the receptor is more responsive to psychoactive cannabinoids than to non-psychoactive cannabinoids8. Here we report the cloning and expression of a complementary DNA that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor with all of these properties. Its messenger RNA is found in cell lines and regions of the brain that have cannabinoid receptors.

The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein of 472 residues which shares 97.3% identity with the rat cannabinoid receptor cloned recently [Matsuda, Lolait, Brownstein, Young & Bronner (1990) Nature (London) 346, 561-564].

Specific binding of the synthetic cannabinoid ligand [3H]CP55940 was observed on membranes from Cos-7 cells transfected with the recombinant receptor clone. In stably transfected CHO-K1 cell lines, cannabinoid agonists mediated a dose-dependent and stereoselective inhibition of forskolin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation.

Dysregulation of these cellular processes is a common neuropathological hallmark in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The broad spectrum of actions of cannabinoids allows targeting different aspects of these multifactorial diseases. In this review, we examine the therapeutic potential of the ECS for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS focusing on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. First, we describe the localization of the molecular components of the ECS and how they are altered under neurodegenerative conditions, either contributing to or protecting cells from degeneration. Second, we address recent advances in the modulation of the ECS using experimental models through different strategies including the direct targeting of cannabinoid receptors with agonists or antagonists, increasing the endocannabinoid tone by the inhibition of endocannabinoid hydrolysis, and activation of cannabinoid receptor-independent effects. Preclinical evidence indicates that cannabinoid pharmacology is complex but supports the therapeutic potential of targeting the ECS. Third, we review the clinical evidence and discuss the future perspectives on how to bridge human and animal studies to develop cannabinoid-based therapies for each neurodegenerative disorder. Finally, we summarize the most relevant opportunities of cannabinoid pharmacology related to each disease and the multiple unexplored pathways in cannabinoid pharmacology that could be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

   abstract = {There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). Ligands activating these G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) include the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, numerous synthetic compounds, and endogenous compounds known as endocannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have also been developed. Some of these ligands activate or block one type of cannabinoid receptormorepotently than the other type. This review summarizes current data indicating the extent to which cannabinoid receptor ligands undergo orthosteric or allosteric interactions with non-CB1, non-CB2 established GPCRs, deorphanized receptors such as GPR55, ligand-gated ion channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and other ion channels or peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors. From these data, it is clear that some ligands that interact similarly with CB1 and/or CB2 receptors are likely to display significantly different pharmacological profiles. The review also lists some criteria that any novel "CB3" cannabinoid receptor or channel should fulfil and concludes that these criteria are not currently met by any non-CB1, non-CB2 pharmacological receptor or channel. However, it does identify certain pharmacological targets that should be investigated further as potential CB3 receptors or channels. These include TRP vanilloid 1, which possibly functions as an ionotropic cannabinoid receptor under physiological and/or pathological conditions, and some deorphanized GPCRs. Also discussed are 1) the ability of CB1 receptors to form heteromeric complexes with certain other GPCRs, 2) phylogenetic relationships that exist between CB1/CB2 receptors and other GPCRs, 3) evidence for the existence of several as-yet-uncharacterized non-CB1, non-CB2 cannabinoid receptors; and 4) current cannabinoid receptor nomenclature.

The signalling and trafficking properties of GPCRs are often highly malleable depending on the cellular context. Such fine-tuning of GPCR function can be attributed in many cases to receptor-interacting proteins that are differentially expressed in distinct cell types. In some cases these GPCR-interacting partners directly mediate receptor signalling, whereas in other cases they act mainly as scaffolds to modulate G protein-mediated signalling. Furthermore, GPCR-interacting proteins can have a big impact on the regulation of GPCR trafficking, localization and/or pharmacological properties. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

MCs also synapse with GABAergic interneurons that mediate feed-forward inhibition onto GCs. Surprisingly, although these circuits have been implicated in both memory formation (e.g., pattern separation) and temporal lobe epilepsy, little is known about activity-dependent plasticity of their synaptic connections. Here, we report that MC-GC synapses undergo a presynaptic, NMDA-receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that requires postsynaptic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB and presynaptic cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA signaling. This LTP is input specific and selectively expressed at MC-GC synapses, but not at the disynaptic inhibitory loop. By increasing the excitation/inhibition balance, MC-GC LTP enhances GC output at the associative MC-GC recurrent circuit and may contribute to dentate-dependent forms of learning and epilepsy.},

It is generally believed that this synaptic plasticity may underlie certain forms of learning and memory. LTP at most synapses involves the activation of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) subtype of glutamate receptor, but LTP at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses is independent of NMDA receptors and has a component that is induced and expressed presynaptically. It appears to be triggered by a rise in presynaptic Ca2+ (refs 2, 3), and requires the activation of protein kinase A, which leads to an increased release of glutamate. A great deal is known about the biochemical steps involved in the vesicular release of transmitter, but none of these steps has been directly implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we show that, although a variety of short-term plasticities are normal, LTP at mossy fibre synapses is abolished in mice lacking the synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) mediate transient and long-lasting synaptic plasticity in several brain structures. In the dentate gyrus, activation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) by exogenous ligands reportedly depresses excitatory synaptic transmission. However, direct evidence of eCB signaling at excitatory synapses in this region has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that eCB release can be induced by a brief postsynaptic depolarization of dentate granule cells (DGCs), which potently and transiently suppresses glutamatergic inputs from mossy cell interneurons (MCs) but not from entorhinal cortex via the lateral and medial perforant paths. This input-specific depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) is calcium-dependent and can be modulated by agonists of cholinergic and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Inhibiting the synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), one of the most abundant eCBs in the brain, by diacyglycerol lipase (DGL) does not abolish DSE. Moreover, preventing the breakdown of anandamide, the other main eCB, does not potentiate DSE. Thus, eCB signaling underlying DSE in the dentate does not require DGL activity and is unlikely to be mediated by anandamide. Finally, we find that manipulations known to induce eCB-LTD at other central synapses do not trigger LTD at MCF-DGC synapses. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This G protein-coupled receptor signals inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, modulation of ion channels, and stimulation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases. In this article, we report that δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active component of marijuana, induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis in primary astrocytes but not in other cells expressing the CB1receptor, such as primary neurons, U373 MG astrocytoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the CB1receptor cDNA. THC-evoked sphingomyelin breakdown in astrocytes was also exerted by the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 and was prevented by the selective CB1antagonist SR141716. By contrast, the effect of THC was not blocked by pertussis toxin, pointing to a lack of involvement of Gi/oproteins. A role for the adaptor protein FAN in CB1receptor-coupled sphingomyelin breakdown is supported by two observations: 1) coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that the binding of FAN to the CB1receptor is enhanced by THC and prevented by SR141716; 2) cells expressing a dominant-negative form of FAN are refractory to THC-induced sphingomyelin breakdown. This is the first report showing that a G-protein-coupled receptor induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis through FAN and that the CB1cannabinoid receptor may signal independently of Gi/oproteins.},

Phosphorylation of neuromodulin decreases its affinity for calmodulin, suggesting that neuromodulin may function to bind and concentrate calmodulin at specific sites within neurons, releasing calmodulin locally in response to phosphorylation by protein kinase C (Alexander, K.A., Cimler, B.M., Meier, K.E., and Storm, D.R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 2 262, 6108-6113). In the present study, we have constructed and characterized several mutant neuromodulins to demonstrate that the amino acid sequence 39-56 is required for calmodulin binding, and that this domain contains the sole in vitro protein kinase C phosphorylation site at serine 41. We also demonstrate that the adjacent phenylalanine 42, interacts hydrophobically with calmodulin. These hydrophobic interactions may be disrupted by the introduction of negative charge at serine 41, and thereby regulate the neuromodulin/calmodulin binding interaction. The sensitivity of the neuromodulin/calmodulin binding interaction to negative charge at serine 41 was determined by substitution of serine 41 with an aspartate or an asparagine residue. The asparagine mutant retained its affinity for calmodulin-Sepharose while the aspartate mutant did not adsorb to calmodulin-Sepharose. We conclude that protein kinase C phosphorylation of neuromodulin abolishes calmodulin binding by introducing negative charges within the calmodulin binding domain at a position adjacent to the phenylalanine.},

Here, we analyze GAP-43 binding to cytoskeletal proteins by two different biochemical assays, by blot overlay and sedimentation. We find that immobilized brain spectrin (BS) is able to bind GAP-43. In contrast, little binding was observed to microtubule proteins and other elements of the cytoskeleton. Since GAP-43 is located presynaptically, it may bind to the presynaptic form of BS (SpIIΣ1).

Chem. 264, 1824-1828), a brain-specific in vitro substrate for protein kinase C (PKC), has been purified to homogeneity from bovine forebrain. The purified protein has a molecular mass of 7837.1 +/- 0.5 Da, determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. In the absence of reducing agent, dimers and higher oligomers accumulated. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels the protein monomer migrated abnormally with an apparent molecular mass of 15,000-19,000 Da, depending on the percentage of polyacrylamide. The native protein is blocked at its amino terminus. The majority of the primary amino acid sequence was determined following proteolytic and chemical fragmentation. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of neurogranin with that of the brain-specific PKC substrate neuromodulin, revealed a strikingly conserved amino acid sequence AA(X)KIQA-SFRGH(X)(X)RKK(X)K. The two proteins are not related over the rest of their sequences. Neurogranin was shown to be phosphorylated in hippocampal slices incubated with 32Pi and phorbol esters stimulated neurogranin phosphorylation, suggesting that neurogranin is likely to be an in vivo substrate for PKC. In vitro phosphorylation of neurogranin by PKC produced a shift of the isoelectric point of the protein (pI 5.6) to a more acidic value (pI 5.4). Tryptic digestion of the phosphorylated protein yielded a single phosphopeptide having the sequence IQASFR, where the serine residue is the phosphorylated amino acid. This phosphopeptide is part of the conserved sequence shared with neuromodulin and also corresponds to the PKC phosphorylation site on neuromodulin (Apel, E. D., Byford, M. F., Au, D., Walsh, K. A., and Storm, D. R. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2330-2335). Evidence was obtained suggesting that neurogranin binds to calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+, a feature that also characterizes neuromodulin. We propose that the amino acid sequence shared by neurogranin and neuromodulin reflects a functional relationship between these two proteins and that the consensus sequence represents a conserved PKC phosphorylation site and a calmodulin binding domain that characterizes a class of brain-specific PKC substrates.},

Such forms or presynaptic plasticity are equally observed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and the list of locations expressing presynaptic LTP and LTD continues to grow. In addition to the mechanistically distinct forms of postsynaptic plasticity, presynaptic plasticity offers a powerful means to modify neural circuits. Awide range of induction mechanisms has been identified, some of which occur entirely in the presynaptic terminal, whereas others require retrograde signaling from the postsynaptic to presynaptic terminals. In spite of this diversity of induction mechanisms, some common induction rules can be identified across synapses. Although the precise molecular mechanism underlying long-term changes in transmitter release in most cases remains unclear, increasing evidence indicates that presynaptic LTP and LTD can occur in vivo and likely mediate some forms of learning. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Neuronal excitability and long-term synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses are critically dependent on the level of inhibition, and accordingly, changes of inhibitory synaptic efficacy should have great impact on neuronal function and neural network processing. We describe here a form of activity-dependent long-term depression at hippocampal inhibitory synapses that is triggered postsynaptically via glutamate receptor activation but is expressed presynaptically. That is, glutamate released by repetitive activation of Schaffer collaterals activates group I metabotropic glutamate receptors at CA1 pyramidal cells, triggering a persistent reduction of GABA release that is mediated by endocannabinoids. This heterosynaptic form of plasticity is involved in changes of pyramidal cell excitability associated with long-term potentiation at excitatory synapses and could account for the effects of cannabinoids on learning and memory.},

   abstract = {It is now clear that, in contrast to traditional descriptions of G protein-coupled receptor signaling, agonists can activate or inhibit characteristic patterns of downstream effector pathways depending on their structures and the conformational changes induced in the receptor. This is referred to as functional selectivity (also known as agonist-directed trafficking, ligand-induced differential signaling, or biased agonism). It is important because even small structural differences can result in significant variations in overall agonist effects (wanted and unwanted) depending on which postreceptor signaling systems are engaged by each agonist/receptor pairing. In addition to the canonical signaling pathways mediated by Gi/o proteins, CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists can have effects via differential activation not only of Gi subtypes but also of Gs and Gq/11 proteins. For example, the classical cannabinoid HU-210 produces maximal activation of both Gi and Go proteins, while the endocannabinoid anandamide and aminoalkylindole WIN 55,212 both produce maximal activation of Gi, but submaximal activation of Go. Cannabinoid agonists can also signal differentially via β-arrestins coupled to mitogen-activated protein kinases, subsequently promoting varying degrees of receptor internalization and agonist desensitization. A recent extensive characterization of the molecular pharmacology of CB2 agonists (Soethoudt et al., 2017) identified marked differences (bias) in the ability of certain agonists to activate distinct signaling pathways (cAMP accumulation, ERK phosphorylation, GIRK activation, GTPγS binding, and β-arrestin recruitment) and to cause off-target effects, exemplifying the need to evaluate functional selectivity in agonist drug development.},

By activating cannabinoid receptors expressed in the central nervous system, these lipid messengers can regulate several neural functions and behaviors. As experimental tools advance, the repertoire of known endocannabinoid-mediated effects at the synapse, and their underlying mechanism, continues to expand. Retrograde signaling is the principal mode by which endocannabinoids mediate short- and long-term forms of plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. However, growing evidence suggests that endocannabinoids can also signal in a nonretrograde manner. In addition to mediating synaptic plasticity, the endocannabinoid system is itself subject to plastic changes. Multiple points of interaction with other neuromodulatory and signaling systems have now been identified. In this Review, we focus on new advances in synaptic endocannabinoid signaling in the mammalian brain. The emerging picture not only reinforces endocannabinoids as potent regulators of synaptic function but also reveals that endocannabinoid signaling is mechanistically more complex and diverse than originally thought.},

   abstract = {To understand the functional significance and mechanisms of action in the CNS of endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids, it is crucial to identify the neural elements that serve as the structural substrate of these actions. We used a recently developed antibody against the CB1 cannabinoid receptor to study this question in hippocampal networks. Interneurons with features typical of basket cells showed a selective, intense staining for CB1 in all hippocampal subfields and layers. Most of them (85.6%) contained cholecystokinin (CCK), which corresponded to 96.9% of all CCK-positive interneurons, whereas only 4.6% of the parvalbumin (PV)-containing basket cells expressed CB1. Accordingly, electron microscopy revealed that CB1- immunoreactive axon terminals of CCK-containing basket cells surrounded the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, whereas PV-positive basket cell terminals in similar locations were negative for CB1. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (0.01-3 μM) reduced dose- dependently the electrical field stimulation-induced [3H]GABA release from superfused hippocampal slices, with an EC50 value of 0.041 μM. Inhibition of GABA release by WIN 55,212-2 was not mediated by inhibition of glutamatergic transmission because the WIN 55,212-2 effect was not reduced by the glutamate blockers AP5 and CNQX. In contrast, the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A (1 μM) prevented this effect, whereas by itself it did not change the outflow of [3H]GABA. These results suggest that cannabinoid-mediated modulation of hippocampal interneuron networks operate largely via presynaptic receptors on CCK-immunoreactive basket cell terminals. Reduction of GABA release from these terminals is the likely mechanism by which both endogenous and exogenous CB1 ligands interfere with hippocampal network oscillations and associated cognitive functions.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids play central roles in retrograde signaling at a wide variety of synapses throughout the CNS. Although several molecular components of the endocannabinoid system have been identified recently, their precise location and contribution to retrograde synaptic signaling is essentially unknown. Here we show, by using two independent riboprobes, that principal cell populations of the hippocampus express high levels of diacylglycerol lipase α (DGL-α), the enzyme involved in generation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). Immunostaining with two independent antibodies against DGL-α revealed that this lipase was concentrated in heads of dendritic spines throughout the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, quantification of high-resolution immunoelectron microscopic data showed that this enzyme was highly compartmentalized into a wide perisynaptic annulus around the postsynaptic density of axospinous contacts but did not occur intrasynaptically. On the opposite side of the synapse, the axon terminals forming these excitatory contacts were found to be equipped with presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. This precise anatomical positioning suggests that 2-AG produced by DGL-α on spine heads may be involved in retrograde synaptic signaling at glutamatergic synapses, whereas CB1 receptors located on the afferent terminals are in an ideal position to bind 2-AG and thereby adjust presynaptic glutamate release as a function of postsynaptic activity. We propose that this molecular composition of the endocannabinoid system may be a general feature of most glutamatergic synapses throughout the brain and may contribute to homosynaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses and to heterosynaptic plasticity between excitatory and inhibitory contacts.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are a family of lipid molecules that act as key regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. They are synthetized “on demand” following physiological and/or pathological stimuli. Once released from postsynaptic neurons, eCBs typically act as retrograde messengers to activate presynaptic type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) and induce short- or long-term depression of neurotransmitter release. Besides this canonical mechanism of action, recent findings have revealed a number of less conventional mechanisms by which eCBs regulate neural activity and synaptic function, suggesting that eCB-mediated plasticity is mechanistically more diverse than anticipated. These mechanisms include non-retrograde signaling, signaling via astrocytes, participation in long-term potentiation, and the involvement of mitochondrial CB1. Focusing on paradigmatic brain areas, such as hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex, we review typical and novel signaling mechanisms, and discuss the functional implications in normal brain function and brain diseases. In summary, eCB signaling may lead to different forms of synaptic plasticity through activation of a plethora of mechanisms, which provide further complexity to the functional consequences of eCB signaling.

Upon ligand activation, CB1Rs may signal in three different spatiotemporal waves. The first wave, which is transient (< 10 minutes) and initiated by heterotrimeric G proteins, is followed by a second wave (> 5 minutes) that is mediated by β-arrestins. The third and final wave occurs at intracellular compartments and could be elicited by G proteins or β-arrestins. This complexity presents multiple challenges, including the correct classification of receptor ligands, the identification of the signaling pathways regulated by each wave, and the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiologic impacts of these waves. Simultaneously, it provides new opportunities to harness the therapeutic potential of the cannabinoid system and other GPCRs. Over the last several years, we have significantly expanded our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways downstream from the CB1R. The identification of receptor mutations that can bias signaling to specific pathways and the use of siRNA technology have been key tools to identifying which signaling cascades are controlled by G proteins or β-arrestins. Here, we review our current knowledge on CB1R signaling, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms and cascades mediated by β-arrestins downstream from the CB1R.},

   abstract = {Visual activity acts via NMDA Receptors to refine developing retinotectal maps by shaping retinal arbors. Retinal axons add and delete transient branches, and the dynamic rates increase when MK801 blocks NMDARs, as if this prevents release of a stabilizing signal. Ca ++ entry through NMDARs activates phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) to release arachidonic acid (AA), which taps into a presynaptic growth control mechanism. NCAM, L1, N-cadherin, and FGF all stimulate axon growth via AA activation of protein kinase C to phosphorylate GAP43 and polymerize/stabilize F-actin. Our previous results show that blocking cPLA2 mimics NMDAR blockers, whereas exogenous AA reverses the increased dynamics, and PKC inhibitors also arrest growth. To test whether this activity-driven F-actin control mechanism shapes retinotectal arbors in zebrafish, we used the alpha-1-tubulin promoter to express GAP43-GFP fusion proteins in retinal ganglion cells, and imaged arbors in time-lapse to test for effects of GAP43 levels and its phosphorylation. Overexpressing wildtype GAP43 gave faster growth and larger arbors (#branches, spatial extent, total length of branches) at three days and especially four days. Surprisingly, the N-terminal 20 amino acid segment alone caused the same increase in branching, but no increase in growth. Earlier studies implicate this region in activating G o resulting in collapse of growth cones, which is now known to precede branch initiation. In contrast, GAP43 with ser41 mutated to ala (S41A) to prevent phosphorylation did not increase either branching or growth but resulted in immature, elongated arbors even at four to five days. In support of this atrophic effect, only half of brain/spinal neurons expressing S41A successfully initiated axonal outgrowth (vs. nearly 100% for wtGAP43). These results suggest that the region around the ser41 phosphorylation site, which binds CaM and PIP2, promotes growth only when phosphorylated, and also activates the branching control region in the first 10-20 amino acids. Whereas phosphorylation introduces a bulky negative charge group, mutation of serine to arginine introduces a bulky positive charge. But this also produced the same growth and branching as phosphorylation, suggesting that the effect of phosphorylation is through hydrophilic bulk rather than negative charge, in agreement with other IQ motifs. The results implicate the cPLA2-AA-PKC-GAP43 pathway as part of an F-actin based mechanism that both stabilizes new synapses and initiates new branches near effective synapses. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The eCBs and their cognate cannabinoid receptors exhibit a number of unique properties that distinguish them from the widely studied classical amino-acid transmitters, neuropeptides, and catecholamines. Although we now have a loose set of mechanistic rules based on experimental findings, new studies continue to reveal that our understanding of the eCB system (ECS) is continuously evolving and challenging long-held conventions. Here we will briefly summarize findings on the current canonical view of the 'ECS' and will address novel aspects that reveal how a nearly ubiquitous system can determine highly specific functions in the brain. In particular, we will focus on findings that push for an expansion of our ideas around long-held beliefs about eCB signaling that, while clearly true, may be contributing to an oversimplified perspective on how cannabinoid signaling at the microscopic level impacts behavior at the macroscopic level.},

The growth-associated protein GAP43 is susceptible to both phosphorylation and S-palmitoylation and is enriched in the tips of extending neurites. However, how phosphorylation and lipidation interplay to mediate sorting of GAP43 is unclear. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and imaging approaches, we show that palmitoylation is required for membrane association and that phosphorylation at Ser-41 directs palmitoylated GAP43 to the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane association decreased the diffusion constant fourfold in neuritic shafts. Sorting to the neuritic tip required palmitoylation and active transport and was increased by phosphorylation-mediated plasma membrane interaction. Vesicle tracking revealed transient association of a fraction of GAP43 with exocytic vesicles and motion at a fast axonal transport rate. Simulations confirmed that a combination of diffusion, dynamic plasma membrane interaction and active transport of a small fraction of GAP43 suffices for efficient sorting to growth cones. Our data demonstrate a complex interplay between phosphorylation and lipidation in mediating the localization of GAP43 in neuronal cells. Palmitoylation tags GAP43 for global sorting by piggybacking on exocytic vesicles, whereas phosphorylation locally regulates protein mobility and plasma membrane targeting of palmitoylated GAP43.},

   abstract = {In a number of animal species, the growth-associated protein (GAP), GAP-43 (aka: F1, neuromodulin, B-50, G50, pp46), has been implicated in the regulation of presynaptic vesicular function and axonal growth and plasticity via its own biochemical properties and interactions with a number of other presynaptic proteins. Changes in the expression of GAP-43 mRNA or distribution of the protein coincide with axonal outgrowth as a consequence of neuronal damage and presynaptic rearrangement that would occur following instances of elevated patterned neural activity including memory formation and development. While functional enhancement in GAP-43 mRNA and/or protein activity has historically been hypothesized as a central mediator of axonal neuroplastic and regenerative responses in the central nervous system, it does not appear to be the crucial substrate sufficient for driving these responses. This review explores the historical discovery of GAP-43 (and associated monikers), its transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation and current understanding of protein interactions and regulation with respect to its role in axonal function. While GAP-43 itself appears to have moved from a pivotal to a supporting factor, there is no doubt that investigations into its functions have provided a clearer understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of axonal plasticity.},

The mechanism by which caspase-3 regulates LTD and AMPA receptor endocytosis, however, remains unclear. Here, we addressed this question by using an enzymatic N-terminal peptide enrichment method and mass spectrometry to identify caspase-3 substrates in neurons. Of the many candidates revealed by this proteomic study, we have confirmed BASP1, Dbn1, and Gap43 as true caspase-3 substrates. Moreover, in hippocampal neurons, Gap43 mutants deficient in caspase-3 cleavage inhibit AMPA receptor endocytosis and LTD. We further demonstrated that Gap43, a protein well-known for its functions in axons, is also localized at postsynaptic sites. Our study has identified Gap43 as a key caspase-3 substrate involved in LTD and AMPA receptor endocytosis, uncovered a novel postsynaptic function for Gap43 and provided new insights into how long-term synaptic depression is induced.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids (ECBs) depress transmitter release at sites throughout the brain. Here, we describe another form of ECB signaling that triggers a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) localized to the lateral perforant path (LPP) which conveys semantic information from cortex to hippocampus. Two cannabinoid CB 1 receptor (CB 1 R) signaling cascades were identified in hippocampus. The first is pregnenolone sensitive, targets vesicular protein Munc18-1 and depresses transmitter release; this cascade is engaged by CB 1 Rs in Schaffer–Commissural afferents to CA1 but not in the LPP, and it does not contribute to LTP. The second cascade is pregnenolone insensitive and LPP specific; it entails co-operative CB 1 R/β1-integrin signaling to effect synaptic potentiation via stable enhancement of transmitter release. The latter cascade is engaged during LPP-dependent learning. These results link atypical ECB signaling to the encoding of a fundamental component of episodic memory and suggest a novel route whereby endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids affect cognition.},

We report that CB 1  cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 Rs) are enriched in the axonal growth cones of γ-aminobutyric acid-containing (GABAergic) interneurons in the rodent cortex during late gestation. Endocannabinoids trigger CB 1 R internalization and elimination from filopodia and induce chemorepulsion and collapse of axonal growth cones of these GABAergic interneurons by activating RhoA. Similarly, endocannabinoids diminish the galvanotropism of Xenopus laevis spinal neurons.

A second excitatory cell type in the dentate gyrus, the mossy cell, forms an intricate circuit with granule cells, CA3c pyramidal cells, and local interneurons, but the influence of mossy cells on dentate function is often overlooked.

This plastic property supports memory and conveys an extraordinary adaptive value, because it allows an individual to learn from, and respond to, changes in the environment. Molecular and physiological changes at the cellular level as well as network interactions are required in order to encode a pattern of synaptic activity into a long-term memory. While the cellular mechanisms linking synaptic plasticity to memory have been intensively studied, those regulating network interactions have received less attention. Combining high-resolution fMRI and in vivo electrophysiology in rats, we have previously reported a functional remodelling of long-range hippocampal networks induced by long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic plasticity in the perforant pathway. Here, we present new results demonstrating an increased bilateral coupling in the hippocampus specifically supported by the mossy cell commissural/associational pathway in response to LTP. This fMRI-measured increase in bilateral connectivity is accompanied by potentiation of the corresponding polysynaptically evoked commissural potential in the contralateral dentate gyrus and depression of the inactive convergent commissural pathway to the ipsilateral dentate. We review these and previous findings in the broader context of memory consolidation.},

Physiological support for such function has been hampered by a lack of well-defined characteristics that can identify granule cells and mossy cells. We developed an electrophysiology-based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell-mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely “inherited” place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation.},

   abstract = {Mossy cells give rise to the commissural and associational pathway of the dentate gyrus, and receive their major excitatory inputs from the mossy fibers of granule cells. Through these feed-back excitatory connections, mossy cells have been suggested to play important roles in both normal signal processing in learning and memory, as well as in seizure propagation. However, the nature of the activity-dependent modifications of the mossy fiber inputs to mossy hilar cells is not well understood. We studied the long- and short-term plasticity properties of the mossy fiber–mossy cell synapse, using the minimal stimulation technique in slices in whole cell recorded mossy cells retrogradely prelabeled with the fluorescent dye DiO from the contralateral dentate gyrus. Following tetanic stimulation, mossy fiber synapses showed significant NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP), associated with increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) amplitude and decreased failure rates. Coefficient of variance and failure rate analyses suggested a presynaptic locus of LTP induction. Mossy fiber synapses on mossy cells also showed activity-dependent short-term modification properties, including both frequency-dependent facilitation (stimuli at higher frequencies evoked larger EPSCs with lower failure rates) and burst facilitation (each EPSC in a burst had a larger amplitude and higher probability of occurrence than the preceding EPSCs within the burst). The data show that mossy fiber–mossy cell synapses exhibit both long- and short-term plasticity phenomena that are generally similar to the mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

TRPV1 is also expressed in the brain where its activation depresses excitatory synaptic transmission. Whether TRPV1 also regulates inhibitory synapses in the brain is unclear. Here, using a combination of pharmacology, electrophysiology, and an in vivo knockdown strategy, we report that TRPV1 activation by capsaicin or by the endocannabinoid anandamide depresses somatic, but not dendritic inhibitory transmission in both rat and mouse dentate gyrus. The effect on somatic inhibition was absent in TRPV1 knock-out mice and was also eliminated by two different TRPV1 shRNAs expressed in dentate granule cells, strongly supporting a functional role for TRPV1 in modulating GABAergic synaptic function. Moreover, TRPV1-mediated depression occurs independently of GABA release, requires postsynaptic Ca(2+) rise and activation of calcineurin, and is likely due to clathrin-dependent internalization of GABA receptors. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel form of compartment-specific regulation whereby TRPV1 channels can modify synaptic function in the brain.},

   abstract = {The adult brain is highly plastic and tends to undergo substantial reorganization after injury to compensate for the lesion effects. It has been shown that such reorganization mainly relies on anatomical and biochemical modifications of the remaining cells which give rise to a network rewiring without reinstating the original morpholo gy of the damaged region. However, few studies have analyzed the neurorepair potential of a neurogenic structure. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze if the DG could restore its original morphology after a lesion and to establish if the structural reorganization is accompanied by behavioral and electrophysiological recovery. Using a subepileptogenic injection of kainic acid (KA), we induced a focal lesion in the DG and assessed in time (1) the loss and recovery of dependent and non dependent DG cognitive functions, (2) the anatomical reorganization of the DG using a stereological probe and immunohistochemical markers for different neuronal maturation stages and, (3) synaptic plasticity as assessed through the induction of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mossy fiber pathway (CA3-DG). Our results show that a DG focal lesion with KA leads to a well delimited region of neuronal loss, disorganization of the structure, the loss of associated mnemonic functions and the impairment to elicit LTP. However, behavioral and synaptic plasticity expression occurs in a time dependent fashion and occurs along the morphological restoration of the DG. These results provide novel information on neural plasticity events associated to functional reorganization after damage. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly frequent and poorly understood condition lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) are critical components of injury, and targeted interventions to reduce their contribution to injury should improve neurobehavioral recovery and outcomes. Recent evidence reveals potential protective, yet short-lived, effects of the endocannabinoids (ECs), 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), on neuroinflammatory and OS processes after TBI. The aim of this study was to determine whether EC degradation inhibition after TBI would improve neurobehavioral recovery by reducing inflammatory and oxidative damage. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5-mm left lateral craniotomy, and TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion. TBI produced apnea (17 ± 5 sec) and a delayed righting reflex (479 ± 21 sec). Thirty minutes post-TBI, rats were randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (alcohol, emulphor, and saline; 1:1:18) or a selective inhibitor of 2-AG ( JZL184, 16 mg/kg) or AEA (URB597, 0.3 mg/kg) degradation. At 24 h post-TBI, animals showed significant neurological and -behavioral impairment as well as disruption of blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Improved neurological and -behavioral function was observed in JZL184-treated animals. BBB integrity was protected in both JZL184- and URB597-treated animals. No significant differences in ipsilateral cortex messenger RNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX2) and protein expression of COX2 or NOX2 were observed across experimental groups. Astrocyte and microglia activation was significantly increased post-TBI, and treatment with JZL184 or URB597 blocked activation of both cell types. These findings suggest that EC degradation inhibition post-TBI exerts neuroprotective effects. Whether repeated dosing would achieve greater protection remains to be examined.

MAGL is broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, and the contributions of different brain cell types to the regulation of 2-AG activity in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissect the cellular anatomy of MAGL-mediated 2-AG metabolism in the brain and show that neurons and astrocytes coordinately regulate 2-AG content and endocannabinoid-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and behavior. We also find that astrocytic MAGL is mainly responsible for converting 2-AG to neuroinflammatory prostaglandins via a mechanism that may involve transcellular shuttling of lipid substrates. Astrocytic-neuronal interplay thus provides distributed oversight of 2-AG metabolism and function and, through doing so, protects the nervous system from excessive CB1 receptor activation and promotes endocannabinoid crosstalk with other lipid transmitter systems.},

   abstract = {The cannabinoid CB2 receptor, which is activated by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), protects striatal neurons from apoptotic death caused by the local administration of malonate, a rat model of Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study, we investigated whether endocannabinoids provide tonic neuroprotection in this HD model, by examining the effect of O-3841, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipases, the enzymes that catalyse 2-AG biosynthesis, and JZL184 or OMDM169, two inhibitors of 2-AG inactivation by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). The inhibitors were injected in rats with the striatum lesioned with malonate, and several biochemical and morphological parameters were measured in this brain area. Similar experiments were also conducted in vitro in cultured M-213 cells, which have the phenotypic characteristics of striatal neurons. O-3841 produced a significant reduction in the striatal levels of 2-AG in animals lesioned with malonate. However, surprisingly, the inhibitor attenuated malonate-induced GABA and BDNF deficiencies and the reduction in Nissl staining, as well as the increase in GFAP immunostaining. In contrast, JZL184 exacerbated malonate-induced striatal damage. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was induced in the striatum 24 h after the lesion simultaneously with other pro-inflammatory responses. The COX-2-derived 2-AG metabolite, prostaglandin E2 glyceryl ester (PGE 2 -G), exacerbated neurotoxicity, and this effect was antagonized by the blockade of PGE 2 -G action with AGN220675. In M-213 cells exposed to malonate, in which COX-2 was also upregulated, JZL184 worsened neurotoxicity, and this effect was attenuated by the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib or AGN220675. OMDM169 also worsened neurotoxicity and produced measurable levels of PGE 2 -G. In conclusion, the inhibition of 2-AG biosynthesis is neuroprotective in rats lesioned with malonate, possibly through the counteraction of the formation of pro-neuroinflammatory PGE 2 -G, formed from COX-2-mediated oxygenation of 2-AG. Accordingly, MAGL inhibition or the administration of PGE 2 -G aggravates the malonate toxicity. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {© 2017 American Chemical Society. The biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of the endocannabinoids tightly regulate endocannabinoid-mediated activation of the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor. Monitoring the activities of these endocannabinoid hydrolases in different brain regions is, therefore, key to gaining insight into spatiotemporal control of CB 1 receptor-mediated physiology. We have employed a comparative chemical proteomics approach to quantitatively map the activity profile of endocannabinoid hydrolases in various mouse brain regions at the same time. To this end, we used two different activity-based probes: fluorophosphonate-biotin (FP-biotin), which quantifies FAAH, ABHD6, and MAG-lipase activity, and MB108, which detects DAGL-α, ABHD4, ABHD6, and ABHD12. In total, 32 serine hydrolases were evaluated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. Comparison of endoca nnabinoid hydrolase activity in the four brain regions revealed that FAAH activity was highest in the hippocampus, and MAGL activity was most pronounced in the frontal cortex, whereas DAGL-α was most active in the cerebellum. Comparison of the activity profiles with a global proteomics data set revealed pronounced differences. This could indicate that post-translational modification of the endocannabinoid hydrolases is important to regulate their activity. Next, the effect of genetic deletion of the CB 1 receptor was studied. No difference in the enzymatic activity was found in the cerebellum, striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of CB 1 receptor knockout animals compared to wild type mice. Our results are in line with previous reports and indicate that the CB 1 receptor exerts no regulatory control over the basal production and degradation of endocannabinoids and that genetic deletion of the CB 1 receptor does not induce compensatory mechanisms in endocannabinoid hydrolase activity.},

   abstract = {It has become well accepted that Huntington disease (HD) is associated with impaired glutamate uptake, resulting in a prolonged time-course of extracellular glutamate that contributes to excitotoxicity. However, the data supporting this view come largely from work in synaptosomes, which may overrepresent nerve-terminal uptake over astrocytic uptake. Here, we quantify real-time glutamate dynamics in HD mouse models by high-speed imaging of an intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR) and electrophysiological recordings of synaptically activated transporter currents in astrocytes. These techniques reveal a disconnect between the results obtained in synaptosomes and those in situ. Exogenous glutamate uptake is impaired in synaptosomes, whereas real-time measures of glutamate clearance in the HD striatum are normal or even accelerated, particularly in the aggressive R6/2 model. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying glutamate dynamics under endogenous release conditions, and suggest that the widely cited uptake impairment in HD does not contribute to pathogenesis.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the widely expressed endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression 3 (eCB-LTD), are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that eCB-LTD depends on the contractile properties of the pre-synaptic actomyosin cytoskeleton. Preventing this contractility, both directly by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II NMII ATPase and indirectly by inhibiting the upstream Rho-associated kinase ROCK, abolished long-term, but not short-term forms of cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity in both inhibitory hippocampal and excitatory cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, using 3D superresolution microscopy, we find an actomyosin contractility-dependent redistribution of synaptic vesicle pools within the presynaptic compartment following cannabinoid receptor activation, leading to vesicle clustering and depletion from the pre-synaptic active zone. These results suggest that cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity is mediated by a nanoscale structural reorganization of the presynaptic compartment produced by actomyosin contraction. By introducing the contractile NMII as an important actin binding/structuring protein in the dynamic regulation of synaptic function, our results open new perspectives in the understanding of mechanisms of synaptic and cognitive function, marijuana intoxication and psychiatric pathogenesis.},

The growth-associated protein GAP-43 is thought to be one determinant of such plasticity, although the molecular mechanism by which it mediates dynamic structural alterations at the synapse is not known. GAP-43 is bound by calmodulin when Ca2+ levels are low, and releases the calmodulin when Ca2+ levels rise, suggesting that calmodulin may act as a negative regulator of GAP-43 during periods of low activity in the neurons. To identify the function of GAP-43 during activity-dependent increases in Ca2+ levels, when it is not bound to calmodulin, we sought proteins with which GAP-43 interacts in the presence of Ca2+. We show here that rabaptin-5, an effector of the small GTPase Rab5 that mediates membrane fusion in endocytosis, is one such protein. We demonstrate that GAP-43 regulates endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling. Modulation of endocytosis by GAP-43, in association with rabaptin-5, may constitute a common molecular mechanism by which GAP-43 regulates membrane dynamics during its known roles in activity-dependent neurotransmitter release and neurite outgrowth},

   abstract = {Many pathways have been proposed as contributing to Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis, but generally the in vivo effects of their perturbation have not been compared with reference data from human patients. Here we examine how accurately mechanistically motivated and genetic HD models recapitulate the striatal gene expression phenotype of human HD. The representative genetic model was the R6/2 transgenic mouse, which expresses a fragment of the huntingtin protein containing a long CAG repeat. Pathogenic mechanisms examined include mitochondrial dysfunction; profiled in 3-nitropropionic acid-treated rats, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice, and PGC-1α knock-out mice; and depletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using heterozygous and forebrain-specific BDNF-knock-out mice (BDNFHET, Emx-BDNFKO). Based on striatal gene expression, we find the BDNF models, both heterozygous and homozygous knock-outs, to be more like human HD than the other HD models. This implicates reduced trophic support as a major pathway contributing to striatal degeneration in HD. Because the majority of striatal BDNF is synthesized by cortical neurons, the data also imply that cortical dysfunction contributes to HD's hallmark effects on the basal ganglia. Finally, the results suggest that striatal lesions caused by mitochondrial toxins may arise via pathways different from those that drive neurodegeneration in HD. Based on these findings, we present a testable model of HD pathogenesis that, unlike most models, begins to account for regional specificity in human HD and the absence of such specificity in genetic mouse models of HD.

These gliotransmitters, which are thought to orchestrate neuroinflammation, remain widely uncharacterized. Recently, we showed that microglial cells produce 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endocannabinoid known to prevent the propagation of harmful neuroinflammation, and that ATP increases this production by threefold at 2.5 min (Witting et al., 2004). Here we show that ATP increases 2-AG production from mouse astrocytes in culture, a response that is more rapid (i.e., significant within 10 sec) and pronounced (i.e., 60-fold increase at 2.5 min) than any stimulus-induced increase in endocannabinoid production reported thus far. Increased 2-AG production from astrocytes requires millimolar amounts of ATP, activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors, sustained rise in intracellular calcium, and diacylglycerol lipase activity. Furthermore, we show that astrocytes express monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the main hydrolyzing enzyme of 2-AG, the pharmacological inhibition of which potentiates the ATP-induced 2-AG production (up to 113-fold of basal 2-AG production at 2.5 min). Our results show that ATP greatly increases, and MGL limits, 2-AG production from astrocytes. We propose that 2-AG may function as a gliotransmitter, with MGL inhibitors potentiating this production and possibly restraining the propagation of harmful neuroinflammation.},

Recent research has begun to unveil their significance in spatial computation of the hippocampus. Here, we used an in vitro model of sharp wave-ripple complexes (SWRs), which contribute to hippocampal memory formation, to investigate MC involvement in this fundamental population activity. We find that a significant fraction of MCs (∼47%) is recruited into the active neuronal network during SWRs in the CA3 area. Moreover, MCs receive pronounced, ripple-coherent, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Finally, we find evidence for SWR-related synaptic activity in granule cells that is mediated by MCs. Given the widespread connectivity of MCs within and between hippocampi, our data suggest a role for MCs as a hub functionally coupling the CA3 and the DG during ripple-associated computations. The functional implication of hippocampal mossy cells (MCs) is thus far poorly understood. Swaminathan et al. demonstrate sub-threshold activity and recruitment of MCs during ripples that are fast neuronal oscillations involved in memory consolidation. These results suggest a pivotal role for MCs in computations occurring during ripple-related brain states.},

Our results suggest that NO, cGMP, cGK, actin, and Rho GTPases including RhoA play important roles in the potentiation and act directly in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, where they contribute to the increase in puncta of synaptic proteins. cGK phosphorylates synaptic VASP during the potentiation, whereas Rho GTPases act both in parallel and upstream of cGMP, in part by maintaining the synaptic localization of soluble guanylyl cyclase.},

However, the relation between the levels of this protein to memory enhancement remains unknown. Here, we studied this issue in transgenic mice (G-Phos) overexpressing native, chick GAP-43. These G-Phos mice could be divided at the behavioral level into "spatial bright" and "spatial dull" groups based on their performance on two hidden platform water maze tasks. G-Phos dull mice showed both acquisition and retention deficits on the fixed hidden platform task, but were able to learn a visible platform task. G-Phos bright mice showed memory enhancement relative to wild type on the more difficult movable hidden platform spatial memory task. In the hippocampus, the G-Phos dull group showed a 50% greater transgenic GAP-43 protein level and a twofold elevated transgenic GAP-43 mRNA level than that measured in the G-Phos bright group. Unexpectedly, the dull group also showed an 80% reduction in hippocampal Tau1 staining. The high levels of GAP-43 seen here leading to memory impairment find its histochemical and behavioral parallel in the observation of Rekart et al. (Neuroscience 126: 579-584) who described elevated levels of GAP-43 protein in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients.

   abstract = {Dentate gyrus (DG) is widely thought to provide a teaching signal that enables hippocampal encoding of memories, but its role during retrieval is poorly understood. Some data and models suggest that DG plays no role in retrieval; others encourage the opposite conclusion. To resolve this controversy, we evaluated the effects of optogenetic inhibition of dorsal DG during context fear conditioning, recall, generalization, and extinction in male mice. We found that (1) inhibition during training impaired context fear acquisition; (2) inhibition during recall did not impair fear expression in the training context, unless mice had to distinguish between similar feared and neutral contexts; (3) inhibition increased generalization of fear to an unfamiliar context that was similar to a feared one and impaired fear expression in the conditioned context when it was similar to a neutral one; and (4) inhibition impaired fear extinction. These effects, as well as several seemingly contradictory published findings, could be reproduced by BACON (Bayesian Context Fear Algorithm), a physiologically realistic hippocampal model positing that acquisition and retrieval both involve coordinated activity in DG and CA3. Our findings thus suggest that DG contributes to retrieval and extinction, as well as to the initial establishment of context fear.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite abundant evidence that the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) plays a critical role in memory, it remains unclear whether the role of DG relates to memory acquisition or retrieval. Using contextual fear conditioning and optogenetic inhibition, we show that DG contributes to both of these processes. Using computational simulations, we identify specific mechanisms through which the suppression of DG affects memory performance. Finally, we show that DG contributes to fear extinction learning, a process in which learned fear is attenuated through exposures to a fearful context in the absence of threat. Our data resolve a long-standing question about the role of DG in memory and provide insight into how disorders affecting DG, including aging, stress, and depression, influence cognitive processes.},

This cross-talk is compromised in hemorrhagic vascular lesions of patients carrying loss-of-function mutations in CCM genes. RhoA/ROCK-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling is central to the disease as it causes unbalanced cell adhesion towards increased cell-extracellular matrix adhesions and destabilized cell-cell junctions. Our study reveals that CCM proteins directly orchestrate ROCK1 and ROCK2 complementary roles on the mechanics of the endothelium. CCM proteins act as a scaffold promoting ROCK2 interactions with VE-cadherin and limiting ROCK1 kinase activity. Loss of CCM1 produces excessive ROCK1-dependent actin stress fibers and destabilizes intercellular junctions. Silencing of ROCK1 but not ROCK2 restores the adhesive and mechanical homeostasis of CCM1/2-depleted endothelial monolayers and rescues cardiovascular defects of ccm1 mutant zebrafish embryos. Conversely, knocking down of Rock2 but not Rock1 in WT zebrafish embryos generates defects reminiscent of the ccm1 mutant phenotypes. Our study uncovers the role of the CCM complex in controlling ROCK1 and ROCK2 to preserve endothelial integrity and drive heart morphogenesis. Moreover, it identifies solely the ROCK1 isoform as therapeutic target for the CCM disease.},

It has also been difficult to directly and selectively manipulate mossy cells to study their function. In light of the new data generated using methods to preferentially eliminate or activate mossy cells in mice, it is timely to ask whether mossy cells have become any less enigmatic than they were in the past.},

One theme to emerge from the studies presented in the chapter is that protein kinase C specifically regulates the durability or persistence of the enhanced synaptic response, possibly by preventing the decay of the response. It does not appear to play a role in the response initiation stages. Another theme is that protein kinase C, as a multifunctional enzyme, may be capable of organizing the major cellular events underlying the persistence of synaptic plasticity by regulating the phosphorylation state of different substrate proteins. The chapter provides evidence that the durability of synaptic plasticity is regulated by protein kinase C and its substrates and reviews evidence that implicates protein kinase C as participating in the regulation of several different cellular processes. Data from acutely anesthetized and chronic preparations indicated that alterations in protein F1 phosphorylation is not an immediate response to high-frequency stimulation, but have a relatively slow onset and persisted for several days. Moreover, these effects are selective for protein F1.},

In the present work, studying the hippocampal reorganization observed in the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine, we carried out quantitative western blotting associated with immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of growth-associated phosphoprotein in the hippocampus of rats in acute, silent and chronic periods of this epilepsy model. The fibers and punctate elements from the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyms were strongly immunostained in animals killed 5 h after status epilepticus, compared with the same region in control animals. Rats presenting partial seizures showed no alterations in the immunostaining pattern compared with saline-treated animals. The hippocampal dentate gyms of animals during the seizure-free period and presenting spontaneous recurrent seizures was also characterized by strong growth-associated phosphoprotein immunostaining of fibers and punctate elements in the inner molecular layer, contrasting with the control group. As determined by western blotting analysis, growth-associated phosphoprotein levels increased following status epilepticus and remained elevated at the later time-points, both during the silent period and during the period of chronic recurring seizures. Pilocarpine-treated animals, which did not develop status epilepticus, showed no change in growth-associated phosphoprotein levels, indicating that status epilepticus is important to induce growth-associated phosphoprotein overexpression. The measurement of this overexpression could represent one of the early signals of hippocampal reorganization due to status epilepticus-induced damage.},

   abstract = {We review recent developments in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar disorder and identify promising future routes to therapeutic innovation. Overall, advances in drug treatment remain quite modest. Antipsychotic drugs are effective in the acute treatment of mania; their efficacy in the treatment of depression is variable with the clearest evidence for quetiapine. Despite their widespread use, considerable uncertainty and controversy remains about the use of antidepressant drugs in the management of depressive episodes. Lithium has the strongest evidence for long-term relapse prevention; the evidence for anticonvulsants such as divalproex and lamotrigine is less robust and there is much uncertainty about the longer term benefits of antipsychotics. Substantial progress has been made in the development and assessment of adjunctive psychosocial interventions. Long-term maintenance and possibly acute stabilisation of depression can be enhanced by the combination of psychosocial treatments with drugs. The development of future treatments should consider both the neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying the disorder. We should continue to repurpose treatments and to recognise the role of serendipity. We should also investigate optimum combinations of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments at different stages of the illness. Clarification of the mechanisms by which different treatments affect sleep and circadian rhythms and their relation with daily mood fluctuations is likely to help with the treatment selection for individual patients. To be economically viable, existing psychotherapy protocols need to be made briefer and more efficient for improved scalability and sustainability in widespread implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using three different methods that lead to hypersynchronous activity in limbic circuits, expression of F1/GAP-43 mRNA can be induced in granule cells which is followed by sprouting in messy fibers, the axons of granule cells. F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression in granule cells was induced in the temporal, but not septal, hippocampus beginning at 12 hours after kainic acid (KA) subcutaneous injection (10 mg/kg). Beginning 2 days after KA treatment, messy fiber sprouts restricted to the temporal hippocampus were observed in the supragranular layer. In the same animal we also observed that levels of protein F1/GAP-43 immunoreactivity in this layer apparently increased at this same 2 day time point and same ventral hippocampal location. F1/GAP-43 protein levels and messy fiber sprouting showed an increase up to 10 days after KA treatment. Sprouting was at a maximum at 40 days, the longest time point studied. These events parallel axonal regeneration with one critical difference: granule cell axons are not damaged by kainate. The rapid onset of axonal growth in the adult is striking and occurs earlier than reported previously (2 days vs. 12 days). Such growth closely associated with elevated levels of protein F1/GAP-43 may occur as a result of a) reactive synaptogenesis caused by the availability of post-synaptic surface on granule cell dendrites at the supragranular layer, b) Hebbian co- activation of the post-synaptic granule cells and their presynaptic afferents, and c) loss of target-derived inhibitory growth factor.

   abstract = {Neuronal expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and the cell adhesion molecule L1 has been correlated with CNS axonal growth and regeneration, but it is not known whether expression of these molecules is necessary for axonal regeneration to occur. We have taken advantage of the fact that Purkinje cells do not express GAP-43 or L1 in adult mammals or regenerate axons into peripheral nerve grafts to test the importance of these molecules for axonal regeneration in vivo. Transgenic mice were generated in which Purkinje cells constitutively express L1 or both L1 and GAP-43 under the Purkinje cell-specific L7 promoter, and regeneration of Purkinje cell axons into peripheral nerve grafts implanted into the cerebellum was examined. Purkinje cells expressing GAP-43 or L1 showed minor enhancement of axonal sprouting. Purkinje cells expressing both GAP-43 and L1 showed more extensive axonal sprouting and axonal growth into the proximal portion of the graft. When a predegenerated nerve graft was implanted into double-transgenic mice, penetration of the graft by Purkinje cell axonal sprouts was strongly enhanced, and some axons grew along the entire intracerebral length of the graft (2.5-3.0 mm) and persisted for several months. The results demonstrate that GAP-43 and L1 coexpressed in Purkinje cells can act synergistically to switch these regeneration-incompetent CNS neurons into a regeneration-competent phenotype and show that coexpression of these molecules is a key regulator of the regenerative ability of intrinsic CNS neurons in vivo.},

   abstract = {The adult mammalian central nervous system has a limited ability to establish new connections and to recover from traumatic or degenerative events. The olivo-cerebellar network represents an excellent model to investigate neuroprotection and repair in the brain during adulthood, due to its high plasticity and ordered synaptic organization. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in these events, we focused on the growth-associated protein GAP-43 (also known as B-50 or neuromodulin). During development, this protein plays a crucial role in growth and in branch formation of neurites, while in the adult it is only expressed in a few brain regions, including the inferior olive (IO) where climbing fibres (CFs) originate. Following axotomy GAP-43 is usually up-regulated in association with regeneration. Here we describe an in vivo lentiviral-mediated gene silencing approach, used for the first time in the olivo-cerebellar system, to efficiently and specifically downregulate GAP-43 in rodents CFs. We show that lack of GAP-43 causes an atrophy of the CF in non-traumatic conditions, consisting in a decrease of its length, branching and number of synaptic boutons. We also investigated CF regenerative ability by inducing a subtotal lesion of the IO. Noteworthy, surviving CFs lacking GAP-43 were largely unable to sprout on surrounding Purkinje cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GAP-43 is essential both to maintain CFs structure in non-traumatic condition and to promote sprouting after partial lesion of the IO.},

We previously showed increased growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression in brain samples resected from patients with cortical dysplasia (CD), which was correlated with duration of epilepsy. Here, we used a rat model of CD to examine the regulation of GAP-43 in the brain and serum over the course of epileptogenesis. Baseline GAP-43 expression was higher in CD animals compared to control non-CD rats. An acute seizure increased GAP-43 expression in both CD and control rats. However, GAP-43 expression decreased by day 15 post-seizure in control rats, which did not develop spontaneous seizures. In contrast, GAP-43 remained up-regulated in CD rats, and over 50% developed chronic epilepsy with increased GAP-43 levels in their serum. GAP-43 protein was primarily located in excitatory neurons, suggesting its functional significance in epileptogenesis. Inhibition of GAP-43 expression by shRNA significantly reduced seizure duration and severity in CD rats after acute seizures with subsequent reduction in interictal spiking. Serum GAP-43 levels were significantly higher in CD rats that developed spontaneous seizures. Together, these results suggest GAP-43 as a key factor promoting epileptogenesis, a possible therapeutic target for treatment of progressive epilepsy and a potential biomarker for epilepsy progression in CD.},

In control mice, these nerve fibers did not express GAP-43, and did not sprout spontaneously.

Thalamocortical afferents to -/- cortex form irregular patches in layer IV within a poorly defined cortical field, which varies between hemispheres, rather than the stereotypic, whisker-specific, segregated map seen in normal animals. Furthermore, many thalamocortical afferents project abnormally to widely separated cortical targets. Taken together, our findings indicate a loss of identifiable whisker territories in the GAP-43 -/- mouse cortex. Here, we present a disrupted somatotopic map phenotype in cortex, in clear contrast to the blurring of boundaries within an ordered whisker map in other barrelless mutants. Our results indicate that GAP-43 expression is critical for the normal establishment of ordered topography in barrel cortex.},

Thus, guinea pigs were prepped to stimulate the CA3 and evoke population spikes in the CA1 neurons in the hippocampus in vivo. Animals were injected with either saline or SCH23390 (a selective DA 1R antagonist), 1-2 h prior to recordings. It was found that tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s, three trains at 15 s intervals) readily produced early-LTP and late-LTP in the saline group. In contrast, none of the guinea pigs pre-treated with SCH23390 developed late-LTP, though early-LTP had been present. Furthermore, both GAP-43 mRNA and protein were up-regulated after LTP induction in the saline group. However, GAP-43 protein up-regulation was blocked in animals treated with SCH23390. Anti-GAP-43 immunoreactivity was intense in CA3/CA1 synaptic regions, whereas GAP-43 mRNA hybridization was localized to somatic layers in the hippocampus. Altogether, our results suggest that dopaminergic DA 1 signaling partly couples GAP-43 and LTP. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

GAP-43 and p-GAP-43 (Ser41) immunoreactivities in the hippocampus were also reduced 4 h after ethanol administration.

This gene transfer abolished the increase in Aβ levels in the hippocampal formations of neprilysin-deficient mice and also reduced the increase in young mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. In the latter case, Aβ levels in the hippocampal formation contralateral to the vector-injected side were also significantly reduced as a result of transport of neprilysin from the ipsilateral side, and in both sides soluble Aβ was degraded more efficiently than insoluble Aβ. Furthermore, amyloid deposition in aged mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was remarkably decelerated. Thus, presynaptic neprilysin has been demonstrated to degrade Aβ efficiently and to retard development of amyloid pathology.},

   abstract = {There is recent evidence supporting the notion that the cannabinoid signaling system plays a modulatory role in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, survival of neural progenitors, neuritic elongation and guidance, and synaptogenesis. This assumption is based on the fact that cannabinoid 1-type receptors (CB1 receptors) and their ligands emerge early in brain development and are abundantly expressed in certain brain regions that play key roles in these processes. We have recently presented in vivo evidence showing that this modulatory action might be exerted through regulating the synthesis of the cell adhesion molecule L1 that is also a key element for those processes. To further explore this issue, we conducted here immunohistochemical studies aimed at determining the cellular substrates of CB1 receptor-L1 interactions in the rat brain during late fetal development. In this period, we previously found that the activation of CB1 receptors increased L1 synthesis in several forebrain white matter regions but not in gray matter areas. Using double labeling studies, we observed here colocalization of both proteins in fiber tracts including the corpus callosum, the adjacent subcortical white matter, the internal capsule and the anterior commissure. Experiments conducted with cultures of fetal rat cortical nerve cells revealed that L1 is present mainly in neurons but not in glial cells. This fact, together with the results obtained in the double labeling studies, would indicate that L1 and CB1 receptors should possibly be present in axons elongating through these white matter tracts, or, alternatively, in migrating neurons. Further experiments confirmed the presence of CB1 receptors in elongating axons, since these receptors colocalized with growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a marker of growth cones, but not with synaptophysin, a marker of active synaptic terminals, in the same forebrain white matter regions. Lastly, using cultured fetal rat cortical neurons, we also observed that the activation of cannabinoid receptors increased the levels of the full-length L1 and altered those of some active proteolytic fragments of this protein whose generation has been associated with specific steps in the process of neuritic elongation in cultured neurons. In summary, we have demonstrated that the effects caused by cannabinoid agonists on L1 are facilitated by the colocalization of this cell adhesion molecule with CB1 receptors in several forebrain white matter regions during fetal brain development. We have provided strong evidence that this phenomenon occurs in axons elongating through these white matter tracts, and we have explored in vitro how cannabinoid receptors influence L1 levels. Considering the role played by L1 in different events related to neural development, our observations support the occurrence of a physiological mechanism by which the cannabinoid system might regulate the process of axonal growth and guidance through regulating the synthesis and function of L1. © 2008 IBRO.},

Here, we dissected the role of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43; also known as neuromodulin and B-50) in axonal structural plasticity by using, as a model, climbing fibers. Single axonal branches were dissected by laser axotomy, avoiding collateral damage to the adjacent dendrite and the formation of a persistent glial scar. Despite the very small denervated area, the injured axons consistently reshape the connectivity with surrounding neurons. At the same time, adult climbing fibers react by sprouting new branches through the intact surroundings. Newly formed branches presented varicosities, suggesting that new axons were more than just exploratory sprouts. Correlative light and electron microscopy reveals that the sprouted branch contains large numbers of vesicles, with varicosities in the close vicinity of Purkinje dendrites. By using an RNA interference approach, we found that downregulating GAP-43 causes a significant increase in the turnover of presynaptic boutons. In addition, silencing hampers the generation of reactive sprouts. Our findings show the requirement of GAP-43 in sustaining synaptic stability and promoting the initiation of axonal regrowth.},

   abstract = {Transcription is essential for neurite and axon outgrowth during development. Recent work points to the involvement of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the regulation of genes important for axon growth and guidance. However, NFAT has not been reported to directly control the transcription of axon outgrowth-related genes. To identify transcriptional targets, we performed an in silico promoter analysis and found a putative NFAT site within the GAP-43 promoter. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that NFAT-3 regulates GAP-43, but unexpectedly, does not promote but represses the expression of GAP-43 in neurons and in the developing brain. Specifically, in neuron-like PC-12 cells and in cultured cortical neurons, the overexpression of NFAT-3 represses GAP-43 activation mediated by neurotrophin signaling. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we also show that prior to neurotrophin activation, endogenous NFAT-3 occupies the GAP-43 promoter in PC-12 cells, in cultured neurons, and in the mouse brain. Finally, we observe that NFAT-3 is required to repress the physiological expression of GAP-43 and other pro-axon outgrowth genes in specific developmental windows in the mouse brain. Taken together, our data reveal an unexpected role for NFAT-3 as a direct transcriptional repressor of GAP-43 expression and suggest a more general role for NFAT-3 in the control of the neuronal outgrowth program.},

Induction of LTP in rat hippocampal slices by high-frequency stimulation of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses significantly increased the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of GAP-43, as assessed by quantitative immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope that is specifically phosphorylated by PKC. The stimulatory effect of high-frequency stimulation on levels of immunoreactive phosphorylated GAP-43 was not observed when 4-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 microM), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was bath-applied during the high-frequency stimulus. This observation supports the hypothesis that a retrograde messenger is produced postsynaptically following NMDA receptor activation and diffuses to the presynaptic terminal to activate PKC. Two retrograde messenger candidates--arachidonic acid and nitric oxide (sodium nitroprusside was used to generate nitric oxide)--were examined for their effects in hippocampal slices on PKC redistribution from cytosol to membrane as an indirect measure of enzyme activation and PKC-specific GAP-43 phosphorylation. Bath application of arachidonic acid, but not sodium nitroprusside, at concentrations that produce synaptic potentiation (100 microM and 1 mM, respectively) significantly increased translocation of PKC immunoreactivity from cytosol to membrane as well as levels of immunoreactive, phosphorylated GAP-43. The stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on GAP-43 phosphorylation was also observed in hippocampal synaptosomes. These results indicate that arachidonic acid may contribute to LTP maintenance by activation of presynaptic PKC and phosphorylation of GAP-43 substrate. The data also suggest that nitric oxide does not activate this signal transduction system and, by inference, activates a distinct biochemical pathway.},

At later times, GAP-43 has also been implicated in the regulation of synaptic transmission and properties of plasticity such as long-term potentiation. In a molecular approach, we have analyzed transgenic mice overexpressing different mutated forms of GAP-43 or deficient in GAP-43 to investigate the role of the molecule in short-term and long-term plasticity. We report that overexpression of a mutated form of GAP-43 that mimics constitutively phosphorylated GAP-43 results in an enhancement of long-term potentiation in CA1 hippocampal slices. This effect is specific, because LTP was affected neither in transgenic mice overexpressing mutated forms of non-phosphorylatable GAP-43 nor in GAP-43 deficient mice. The increased LTP observed in transgenic mice expressing a constitutively phosphorylated GAP-43 was associated with an increased paired-pulse facilitation as well as an increased summation of responses during high frequency bursts. These results indicate that, while GAP-43 is not necessary for LTP induction, its phosphorylation may regulate presynaptic properties, thereby affecting synaptic plasticity and the induction of LTP.},

   abstract = {Perforant path long-term potentiation (LTP) in intact mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus increased the neuron-specific, growth-associated protein GAP-43 mRNA in hilar cells 3 days after tetanus, but surprisingly not in granule cells, the perforant path target. This increase was positively correlated with level of enhancement and restricted to central hilar cells on the side of stimulation. Blockade of LTP by puffing DL-aminophosphonovalerate (APV), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker into the molecular layer, eliminated LTP-induced GAP-43 mRNA elevation in hilar cells. To determine whether the mRNA elevation was mediated by transcription, LTP was studied in transgenic mice bearing a GAP-43 promoter-lacZ reporter gene. Promoter activity as indexed by Transgene expression (PATE) increased as indicated by blue staining of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase. Potentiation induced a blue band bilaterally in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus along the entire septotemporal axis. Because mossy cells are the only neurons in the central hilar zone that project to the inner molecular layer bilaterally along the entire septotemporal axis and LTP-induced activation of PATE in this zone was confined to the side of stimulation, we concluded that mossy cells were unilaterally activated, increasing synthesis of beta-galactosidase, which was transported bilaterally. Neither granule cells nor pyramidal cells demonstrated increased PATE or increased GAP-43 mRNA levels. These results and recent evidence indicating the necessity of hilar neurons for LTP point to previously unheralded mossy cells as potentially critical for perforant path LTP and the GAP-43 in these cells as important for LTP persistence lasting days.},

Over the past few decades, observations based on a large volume of work, first examining the pharmacological effects of exogenous cannabinoids, and then the physiological functions of eCBs, have directly challenged long-held and dogmatic views about communication, plasticity and behavior in the central nervous system (CNS). The eCBs and their cognate cannabinoid receptors exhibit a number of unique properties that distinguish them from the widely studied classical amino-acid transmitters, neuropeptides, and catecholamines. Although we now have a loose set of mechanistic rules based on experimental findings, new studies continue to reveal that our understanding of the eCB system (ECS) is continuously evolving and challenging long-held conventions. Here we will briefly summarize findings on the current canonical view of the 'ECS' and will address novel aspects that reveal how a nearly ubiquitous system can determine highly specific functions in the brain. In particular, we will focus on findings that push for an expansion of our ideas around long-held beliefs about eCB signaling that, while clearly true, may be contributing to an oversimplified perspective on how cannabinoid signaling at the microscopic level impacts behavior at the macroscopic level.},

However, the anatomical organization of the neuronal substrates that express 2-AG/CB1signaling system-related molecules associated with selective Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) is still unknown. For this purpose, we used double-label immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy for the characterization of the expression of the 2-AG/CB1signaling system (CB1receptor, DAGLα, MAGL, and FAAH) and the CaBPs calbindin D28k, calretinin, and parvalbumin in the rat hippocampus. CB1, DAGLα, and MAGL labeling was mainly localized in fibers and neuropil, which were differentially organized depending on the hippocampal CaBPs-expressing cells. CB+1fiber terminals localized in all hippocampal principal cell layers were tightly attached to calbindin+cells (granular and pyramidal neurons), and calretinin+and parvalbumin+interneurons. DAGLα neuropil labeling was selectively found surrounding calbindin+principal cells in the dentate gyrus and CA1, and in the calretinin+and parvalbumin+interneurons in the pyramidal cell layers of the CA1/3 fields. MAGL+terminals were only observed around CA1 calbindin+pyramidal cells, CA1/3 calretinin+interneurons and CA3 parvalbumin+interneurons localized in the pyramidal cell layers. Interestingly, calbindin+pyramidal cells expressed FAAH specifically in the CA1 field. The identification of anatomically related-neuronal substrates that expressed 2-AG/CB1signaling system and selective CaBPs should be considered when analyzing the cannabinoid signaling associated with hippocampal functions. © 2014 Rivera, Arrabal, Cifuentes, Grondona, Pérez-Martín, Rubio, Vargas, Serrano, Pavón, Suárez and Rodríguez de Fonseca.},

CB1 activity plays a crucial role in learning and memory and in synaptic plasticity. In the present study, the role of CB1 was investigated in three different hippocampus-dependent memory tasks and in in vivo hippocampal synaptic plasticity in knockout (CB1-ko) and wildtype mice. There was no difference in short-term and long-term social and object recognition memory between CB1-ko and wildtype mice. In contrast, in background contextual fear conditioning CB1-ko mice showed enhanced freezing levels in the conditioning context and increased generalised contextual fear after a high-intensity conditioning foot shock of 1.5. mA, but not after 0.7. mA. In in vivo field potential recordings in the dentate gyrus, CB1-ko mice displayed a decreased paired-pulse facilitation of the populations spikes, suggesting an altered inhibitory synaptic drive onto hippocampal granule cells. Furthermore, CB1-ko mice displayed significantly higher levels of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. In conclusion, CB1 deficiency leads to enhanced contextual fear memory and altered synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, supporting the key role of endocannabinoid signalling in learning and memory, in particular following highly aversive encounters. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In brain tissue reacted with the antibody, the heaviest immunoreactivity was found in associative areas of the neocortex, particularly within layers 1 and 6, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the caudate putamen, and the amygdala. In contrast, primary sensory or motor regions of the cortex, portions of dorsal thalamus, and cerebellum showed only light staining.

This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) can be observed as a transient reduction in frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) or as a transient reduction in amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). We find that DSI of eIPSCs as observed in hilar mossy cells is enhanced by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocked by chelation of postsynaptic calcium, and critically dependent on retrograde activation of presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. We further report that activation of CB1 receptors on GABAergic afferents to hilar mossy cells (by either endogenous or exogenous agonists) preferentially inhibits calcium-dependent exocytosis and that endocannabinoid-dependent retrograde signaling in this system is subject to tight spatial constraints.},

The hilus occupies a strategic position within the dentate gyrus from which it can play a pivotal role in these functions. Inputs from dentate granule cells converge on the hilus, and excitatory hilar mossy cells redistribute these signals back to granule cells to transform a pattern of cortical input into a new pattern of output to the hippocampal CA3 region. Using voltage-sensitive dye to image electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices, we explored how long-term potentiation (LTP) of different excitatory synapses modifies the flow of information. Theta burst stimulation of the perforant path potentiated responses throughout the molecular layer, but left responses in the CA3 region unchanged. By contrast, theta burst stimulation of the granule cell layer potentiated responses throughout the molecular layer, as well as in the CA3 region. Theta burst stimulation of the granule cell layer potentiated CA3 responses not only to granule cell layer stimulation but also to perforant path stimulation. Potentiation of responses in the CA3 region reflected NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of upstream synapses between granule cells and mossy cells, with no detectable contribution from NMDA receptor-independent LTP of local CA3 mossy fiber synapses. Potentiation of transmission to the CA3 region required LTP in both granule cell[-&gt;]mossy cell and mossy cell[-&gt;]granule cell synapses. This bidirectional plasticity enables hilar circuitry to regulate the flow of information through the dentate gyrus and on to the hippocampus.},

   abstract = {Granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus receive two powerful excitatory inputs: the perforant path, originating from the entorhinal cortex, and the associational pathway, originating from mossy cells, the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus hilus. We examined the electrophysiological properties of the less well-studied associational pathway and its interaction with the perforant path in the intact mouse hippocampus and then tested homosynaptic, trans-synaptic and associative long-term potentiation of these pathways. The associational pathway was either monosynaptically activated by stimulation within the inner molecular layer or trisynaptically activated after stimulation of the perforant path. Laminar profiles of extracellularly recorded associational pathway field potentials demonstrated a bell-shaped curve with a peak in the inner molecular layer. Tetanization of the perforant path induced not only homosynaptic potentiation of the perforant path (162.4 ± 6.7% at 0.5-1.5 h after tetanus) but also heterosynaptic potentiation of the associational pathway (115.7 ± 4.9%). Direct tetanization of the associational pathway within the inner molecular layer was ineffective in either the septo-temporal (97.2 ± 4.5%) or temporal-septal (104.4 ± 4.6%) direction. In contrast, conjoint tetanization of the associational pathway with the perforant path potentiated the associational pathway responses in both the septo-temporal (123.4 ± 5.8%) and the temporal-septal (124.8 ± 7.3%) directions. Paired-pulse facilitation was attenuated by long-term potentiation in the perforant path and the associational pathway, suggesting pre-synaptic involvement. These results demonstrate that long-term potentiation of the associational pathway and the perforant path is a product of the network properties of the dentate gyrus rather than of each monosynaptic input alone. The architecture of this neural network may be designed for flexible dynamic associations of the afferent perforant path inputs to configure encoded information within hippocampal neuronal ensembles.},

   abstract = {© 2016 International Society for Neurochemistry Cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) is a CB1receptor (CB1R) distal C-terminus-associated protein that modulates CB1R signaling via G proteins, and CB1R down-regulation but not desensitization (Blume et al. [2015] Cell Signal., 27, 716–726; Smith et al. [2015] Mol. Pharmacol., 87, 747–765). In this study, we determined the involvement of CRIP1a in CB1R plasma membrane trafficking. To follow the effects of agonists and antagonists on cell surface CB1Rs, we utilized the genetically homogeneous cloned neuronal cell line N18TG2, which endogenously expresses both CB1R and CRIP1a, and exhibits a well-characterized endocannabinoid signaling system. We developed stable CRIP1a-over-expressing and CRIP1a-siRNA-silenced knockdown clones to investigate gene dose effects of CRIP1a on CB1R plasma membrane expression. Results indicate that CP55940 or WIN55212-2 (10 nM, 5 min) reduced cell surface CB1R by a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent process, and this was attenuated by CRIP1a over-expression. CP55940-mediated cell surface CB1R loss was followed by a cycloheximide-sensitive recovery of surface receptors (30–120 min), suggesting the requirement for new protein synthesis. In contrast, WIN55212-2-mediated cell surface CB1Rs recovered only in CRIP1a knockdown cells. Changes in CRIP1a expression levels did not affect a transient rimonabant (10 nM)-mediated increase in cell surface CB1Rs, which is postulated to be as a result of rimonabant effects on ‘non-agonist-driven’ internalization. These studies demonstrate a novel role for CRIP1a in agonist-driven CB1R cell surface regulation postulated to occur by two mechanisms: 1) attenuating internalization that is agonist-mediated, but not that in the absence of exogenous agonists, and 2) biased agonist-dependent trafficking of de novo synthesized receptor to the cell surface.

   abstract = {The excitability of the central nervous system depends largely on the
surface density of neurotransmitter receptors. The endocannabinoid
receptor 1 (CB1R) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu(8)R are
expressed pre-synaptically where they reduce glutamate release into the
synaptic cleft. Recently, the CB1R interacting protein cannabinoid
receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) was identified and
characterized to regulate CB1R activity in neurons. However, underlying
molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identified a common
mechanism used by CRIP1a to regulate the cell surface density of two
different types of G-protein coupled receptors, CB1R and mGlu(8a)R. Five
amino acids within the CB1R C-terminus were required and sufficient to
reduce constitutive CB1R endocytosis by about 72\{%\} in the presence of
CRIP1a. Interestingly, a similar sequence is present in mGlu(8a)R and
consistently, endocytosis of mGlu(8a)R depended on CRIP1a, as well.
Docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations identified a
conserved serine in CB1R (S468) and mGlu(8a)R (S894) that forms a
hydrogen bond with the peptide backbone of CRIP1a at position R82. In
contrast to mGlu(8a)R, the closely related mGlu(8b)R splice-variant
carries a lysine (K894) at this position, and indeed, mGlu(8b)R
endocytosis was not affected by CRIP1a. Chimeric constructs between
CB1R, mGlu(8a)R, and mGlu(8b)R underline the role of the identified five
CRIP1a sensitive amino acids. In summary, we suggest that CRIP1a
negatively regulates endocytosis of two different G-protein coupled
receptor types, CB1R and mGlu(8a)R.},

   abstract = {A key role for DAG lipase activity in the control of axonal growth and guidance in vitro and in vivo has been established. For example, DAG lipase activity is required for FGF-stimulated calcium influx into neuronal growth cones, and this response is both necessary and sufficient for an axonal growth response. The mechanism that couples the hydrolysis of DAG to the calcium response is not known. The initial hydrolysis of DAG at the sn-1 position (by DAG lipase) will generate 2-arachidonylglycerol, and this molecule is well established as an endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist in the brain. In the present paper, we show that in rat cerebellar granule neurons, CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists inhibit axonal growth responses stimulated by N-cadherin and FGF2. Furthermore, three CB1 receptor agonists mimic the N-cadherin/FGF2 response at a step downstream from FGF receptor activation, but upstream from calcium influx into cells. In contrast, we could find no evidence for the CB1 receptor coupling the TrkB neurotrophin receptor to an axonal growth response in the same neurons. The observation that the CB1 receptor can couple the activated FGF receptor to an axonal growth response raises novel therapeutic opportunities.},

Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are sparsely distributed throughout the NAc, forming local feedforward inhibitory circuits. It remains elusive how FSI-based feedforward circuits regulate the output of NAc MSNs. Here, we investigated a distinct subpopulation of NAc FSIs that express the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). Using a combination of paired electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological approaches, we characterized and compared feedforward inhibition of NAc MSNs from CB1+ FSIs and lateral inhibition from recurrent MSN collaterals. We observed that CB1+ FSIs exerted robust inhibitory control over a large percentage of nearby MSNs in contrast to local MSN collaterals that provided only sparse and weak inhibitory input to their neighboring MSNs. Furthermore, CB1+ FSI-mediated feedforward inhibition was preferentially suppressed by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, whereas MSN-mediated lateral inhibition was unaffected. Finally, we demonstrated that CB1+ FSI synapses onto MSNs are capable of undergoing experience-dependent long-term depression in a voltage- and eCB-dependent manner. These findings demonstrated that CB1+ FSIs are a major source of local inhibitory control of MSNs and a critical component of the feedforward inhibitory circuits regulating the output of the NAc.},

We report the discovery of two structurally related CB1 cannabinoid receptor interacting proteins (CRIP1a and CRIP1b) that bind to the distal C-terminal tail of CB1. CRIP1a and CRIP1b are generated by alternative splicing of a gene located on chromosome 2 in humans, and orthologs of CRIP1a occur throughout the vertebrates, whereas CRIP1b seems to be unique to primates. CRIP1a coimmunoprecipitates with CB1 receptors derived from rat brain homogenates, indicating that CRIP1a and CB1 interact in vivo. Furthermore, in superior cervical ganglion neurons coinjected with CB1 and CRIP1a or CRIP1b cDNA, CRIP1a, but not CRIP1b, suppresses CB1-mediated tonic inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Discovery of CRIP1a provides the basis for a new avenue of research on mechanisms of CB1 regulation in the nervous system and may lead to development of novel drugs to treat disorders where modulation of CB1 activity has therapeutic potential (e.g., chronic pain, obesity, and epilepsy).},

   abstract = {Neuronal Nitric Oxide synthase, unlike its endothelial and inducible counterparts, displays a PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain located at its N-terminus involved in subcellular targeting. The C-termini of various cellular proteins insert within the binding groove of this PDZ domain and determine the subcellular distribution of nNOS. The molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are poorly understood since the PDZ domain of nNOS can apparently exhibit class I, class II and class III binding specificity. In addition, it has been recently suggested that the PDZ domain of nNOS binds with very low affinity to the C-termini of target proteins and a necessary simultaneous lateral interaction must take place for binding to occur. We describe herein that the PDZ domain of nNOS can behave as a bona fide class III PDZ domain and bind to C-terminal sequences with acidic residues at the P-2 position with low micromolar binding constants. Binding to C-terminal sequences with a hydrophobic residue at the P-2 position plus an acidic residue at the P-3 position (class II binding) can also occur, although interactions involving residues extending up to the P-7 position mediate this type of binding. This promiscuous behavior also extends to its association to class I sequences, which must display a Glu residue at P-3 and a Thr residue at P-2. By means of site directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy we have been able to identify the residues involved in each specific type of binding and rationalize the mechanisms used to recognize binding partners. Finally, we have analyzed the high-affinity association of the PDZ domain of nNOS to claudin-3 and claudin-14, two tight-junction tetraspan membrane proteins that are essential components of the paracellular barrier.},

Although the growth-associated, protein kinase C (PKC) substrate GAP-43 has been oft-implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory, it has never been demonstrated that a reduction in the level of this protein has a deleterious effect on memory, because most homozygotes die perinatally. In this report, we observe significant memory impairments in heterozygous GAP-43 knockout mice with GAP-43 levels reduced by one-half. Impaired memory for a context was demonstrated in contextual fear conditioning. Importantly, no significant impairments in cued conditioning or on tests of nociceptive or auditory perception were observed in the heterozygous knockout, indicating that the observed impairments were unlikely related to performance or acquisition factors and are the result of reduced GAP-43 levels in the hippocampus. The present results, taken together with the prior demonstration of enhanced memory in transgenic mice overexpressing GAP-43, provide strong evidence for a pivotal role of hippocampal GAP-43 in the bidirectional regulation of mnemonic processing.},

Null mutation of the GAP-43 gene disrupts axonal pathfinding and is generally lethal shortly after birth. Manipulations of GAP-43 expression likewise have profound effects on neurite outgrowth for cells in culture. GAP-43 appears to be involved in transducing intra- and extracellular signals to regulate cytoskeletal organization in the nerve ending. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C is particularly significant in this regard, and is linked with both nerve-terminal sprouting and long-term potentiation. In the brains of humans and other primates, high levels of GAP-43 persist in neocortical association areas and in the limbic system throughout life, where the protein might play an important role in mediating experience-dependent plasticity.},

Protein kinases (PKs) and phosphatases (PPs) are among the most important of these components that act as positive and negative regulators of neuronal signaling and plasticity, respectively. In these cascades, the PP protein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin (CaN) is of particular interest because it is the only Ca(2+)-activated PP in the brain and a major regulator of key proteins essential for synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This review describes the primary properties of CaN and illustrates its functions and modes of action by focusing on several representative targets, in particular glutamate receptors, striatal enriched protein phosphatase (STEP), and neuromodulin (GAP43), and their functional significance for synaptic plasticity and memory.},

GAP-43 becomes bound via palmitoylation and the presence of three basic residues to membranes of the early secretory pathway. It is then sorted onto vesicles at the late secretory pathway for fast axonal transport to the growth cone or presynaptic plasma membrane. The palmitate chains do not serve as permanent membrane anchors for GAP-43, because at steady-state most of the GAP-43 in a cell is membrane-bound but is not palmitoylated. Filopodial extension and branching take place when GAP-43 is phosphorylated at Ser-41 by protein kinase C, and this occurs following neurotrophin binding and the activation of numerous small GTPases. GAP-43 has been proposed to cluster the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in plasma membrane rafts. Following GAP-43 phosphorylation, this phospholipid is released to promote local actin filament-membrane attachment. The phosphorylation also releases GAP-43 from calmodulin. The released GAP-43 may then act as a lateral stabilizer of actin filaments. N-terminal fragments of GAP-43, containing 10-20 amino acids, will activate heterotrimeric G proteins, direct GAP-43 to the membrane and lipid rafts, and cause the formation of filopodia, possibly by causing a change in membrane tension. This review will focus on new information regarding GAP-43, including its binding to membranes and its incorporation into lipid rafts, its mechanism of action, and how it affects and is affected by extracellular agents.},

Although most neurons cease expressing high levels of GAP-43 after the completion of synaptogenesis (Jacobson et al., 1986), certain brain regions continue to have considerable amounts of the protein throughout life (Oestreicher et al., 1986); in at least one such area, the phosphorylation of the protein has been linked with the events that underlie synaptic potentiation (Lovinger et al., 1985). In this study, we used the indirect immunoperoxidase method to map the distribution of GAP-43/B-50 in the brains of 8 adult rats with 2 different antibodies: a monospecific, polyclonal antibody prepared in sheep against the purified protein and an affinity-purified IgG prepared in rabbits. Specific immunoreactivity was found primarily in the neuropil and followed a generally increasing caudal-to-rostral gradient along the neuraxis. Densest staining occurred in layer I of the cortex, the CA1 field of the hippocampus, and in a continuum of subcortical structures that included the caudate-putamen, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, and medial preoptic area-hypothalamus. In the brain stem, staining was seen in the central gray and in ascending visceral relay nuclei, but was essentially absent in areas related to ascending somatosensory information (e.g., the cochlear nuclei or vestibular complex) and motor control (e.g., nucleus ruber or the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves). Staining in dorsal thalamus was likewise modest in most somatosensory and somatomotor relay nuclei, but dark in certain other structures (e.g., mediodorsal nucleus, lateral complex). This distributional pattern raises the question of whether synapses in all areas containing high levels of GAP-43/B-50 are capable of undergoing functional plasticity, or whether the protein may function in some of these areas in some other capacity (e.g., general signal transduction).},

   abstract = {The addition of palmitate to cysteine residues enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins, and consequently their membrane association. Here we have investigated whether this type of fatty acylation also regulates protein-protein interactions. GAP-43 is a neuronal protein that increases guanine nucleotide exchange by heterotrimeric G proteins. Two cysteine residues near the N-terminus of GAP-43 are subject to palmitoylation, and are necessary for membrane binding as well as for G(o) activation. N-terminal peptides, which include these cysteines, stimulate G(o). Monopalmitoylation reduces, and dipalmitoylation abolishes the activity of the peptides. The activity of GAP-43 protein purified from brain also is reversibly blocked by palmitoylation. This suggests that palmitoylation controls a cycle of GAP-43 between an acylated, membrane-bound reservoir of inactive GAP-43, and a depalmitoylated, active pool of protein.},

   abstract = {Regional distribution of gene expression of the axonal growth‐associated protein, GAP‐43, was studied in adult rat brains by in situ hybridization autoradiography to determine the features of mature neuronal populations that synthesize GAP‐43 protein. Such synthesis appears to correlate with axonal growth during maturation and regrowth after axotomy. In most adult neurons, the sharp decline in GAP‐43 gene expression implies a reduced capacity for axonal growth. Neurons capable of extending axonal knobs in the absence of injury may indicate a “plasticity” underlying dynamic processes of interaction between neurons and their synaptic targets. Antisense and sense (control) riboprobes were used on serial sections in the three principal axes, and the magnitude of hybridization signal was examined to determine regional patterns. GAP‐43 mRNA levels are pronounced in diverse neuronal groups including the locus coeruleus, raphé nn., dopaminergic nigral and ventral tegmental nn., mitral cells, hippocampal CA3, inferior olivary n., vagal motor n. and other parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, select thalamic midline and intralaminar nn., several specific nn. of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain, the granular layer of cerebellar cortex, the infragranular neocortex, and the granular olfactory paleocortex; there is substantial range in the magnitude of expression. Regions revealing minimal signal include most thalamic sensory relay nuclei, the granule neurons of the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus, and the caudate and putamen. Possible concomitants of GAP‐43 expression include regulation of ion flux and neurotrans‐mitter release. Those neurons with long, extensively dispersed and numerous synaptic connections display the strongest signals and may possess the greatest propensity for continuous growth and turnover of their axon terminals, in contrast to short‐axon and specific projection neurons exhibiting minimal levels. These data may enable inferring which populations display normal or experimentally induced axonal growth. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {We have previously shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) selectively stabilizes the GAP-43 mRNA in PC12 cells. To study the cellular mechanisms for this post-transcriptional control and to determine the contribution of mRNA stability to GAP-43 gene expression, we examined the effects of several agents that affect PC12 cell differentiation on the level of induction and rate of degradation of the GAP-43 mRNA. The NGF-mediated increase in GAP-43 mRNA levels and neurite outgrowth was mimicked by the phorbol ester TPA, but not by dibutyryl cAMP or the calcium ionophore A12783. Downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by high doses of phorbol esters or selective PKC inhibitors prevented the induction of this mRNA by NGF, suggesting that NGF and TPA act through a common PKC-dependent pathway. In mRNA decay studies, phorbol esters caused a selective 6-fold increase in the half-life of the GAP-43 mRNA, which accounts for most of the induction of this mRNA by TPA. The phorbol ester-induced stabilization of GAP-43 mRNA was blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor polymyxin B and was partially inhibited by dexamethasone, an agent that blocks GAP-43 expression and neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. In contrast, the rates of degradation and the levels of the GAP-43 mRNA in control and TPA-treated cells were not affected by cycloheximide treatment. Thus, changes in GAP-43 mRNA turnover do not appear to require continuous protein synthesis. In conclusion, these data suggest that PKC activity regulates the levels of the GAP-43 mRNA in PC12 cells through a novel, translation-independent mRNA stabilization mechanism.},

It has long been known that in most cell types, one or more PKC isoforms influences the morphology of the F-actin cytoskeleton and thereby regulates processes that are affected by remodelling of the microfilaments. These include cellular migration and neurite outgrowth. This review focuses on the role of classical and novel PKC isoforms in migration and neurite outgrowth, and highlights some regulatory steps that may be of importance in the regulation by PKC of migration and neurite outgrowth. Many studies indicate that integrins are crucial mediators both upstream and downstream of PKC in inducing morphological changes. Furthermore, a number of PKC substrates, directly associated with the microfilaments, such as MARCKS, GAP43, adducin, fascin, ERM proteins and others have been identified. Their potential role in PKC effects on the cytoskeleton is discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the past 25 years, candidate growth genes have been implicated in learning processes, but it has not been demonstrated that they in fact enhance them. Here, we show that genetic overexpression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, the axonal protein kinase C substrate, dramatically enhanced learning and long-term potentiation in transgenic mice. If the overexpressed GAP-43 was mutated by a Ser --> Ala substitution to preclude its phosphorylation by protein kinase C, then no learning enhancement was found.

   abstract = {UNLABELLED This study evaluates single-cell indicators of glutamate transport in sulforhodamine 101-positive astrocytes of Q175 mice, a knock-in model of Huntington's disease (HD). Transport-related fluorescent ratio signals obtained with sodium-binding benzofuran isophtalate (SBFI) AM from unperturbed or voltage-clamped astrocytes and respective glutamate transporter currents (GTCs) were induced by photolytic or synaptic glutamate release and isolated pharmacologically. The HD-induced deficit ranged from -27% (GTC maximum at -100 mV in Ba(2+)) to -41% (sodium transients in astrocytes after loading SBFI-AM). Our specific aim was to clarify the mechanism(s) by which Kir4.1 channels can influence glutamate transport, as determined by either Na(+) imaging or transport-associated electrical signals. A decrease of Kir4.1 conductance was mimicked with Ba(2+) (200 μm), and an increase of Kir4.1 expression was obtained by intravenous administration of AAV9-gfaABC1D-Kir4.1-EGFP. The decrease of Kir4.1 conductance reduced the sodium transients but increased the amplitudes of somatic GTCs. Accordingly, after genetic upregulation of Kir4.1, somatic GTCs were found to be decreased. In individual cells, there was a negative correlation between Kir4.1 currents and GTCs. The relative effect of the Kir4.1 conductance was higher in the astrocyte periphery. These and other results suggest that the Kir4.1 conductance affects glutamate transporter activity in a dual manner: (1) by providing the driving force (voltage dependency of the transport itself) and (2) by limiting the lateral charge transfer (thereby reducing the interference with other electrogenic transporter functions). This leads to the testable prediction that restoring the high conductance state of passive astrocytes will not only normalize glutamate uptake but also restore other astrocytic transporter activities afflicted with HD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Insufficiency of astrocytic glutamate uptake is a major element in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the heterogeneity of astrocytes and their differential susceptibility to therapeutic interventions, it becomes necessary to evaluate the determinants of transport activity in individual astroglial cells. We have examined intracellular Na(+) transients and glutamate transporter currents as the most telling indicators of glutamate clearance after synaptic or photolytic release of glutamate in striatal slices. The results show that, in Huntington's disease, glutamate uptake activity critically depends on Kir4.1. These channels enable the high conductance state of the astrocytic plasma membrane, which ensures the driving force for glutamate transport and dumps the transport-associated depolarization along the astrocyte processes. This has significant implications for developing therapeutic targets.},

However, during the past ten years it has become clear that astrocytes may also induce changes in synaptic glutamate release when respective pathways must cope with the consequences of brain damage or other alterations in their functional requirements. The loss of glutamatergic synapses in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease is likely to associate with a continuous redistribution of presynaptic activity within the pool of surviving synapses, and astrocytes may have a role in the maintenance of independent control at individual glutamate release sites. The rodent striatum should be a good model structure to analyse astrocyte-synapse interactions underlying disease-related plasticity, because it does not itself contain any glutamatergic neurons. Here we examine recent results that may shed light on the mechanisms underlying pathway-specific alterations in the corticostriatal or thalamostriatal synaptic transmission with a possible involvement of astrocytic release or uptake of glutamate. The conclusions emphasize the need of exploring the highly compartmentalised and presumably heterogeneous synapse astrocyte-interactions at a single synapse level.},

To better understand the relationship between CB1 and BDNF levels in a situation where the striatum is degenerating, we studied, by dual label immunofluorescence, the distribution of CB1 and BDNF in cortical neurons projecting to the striatum in our rat quinolinic acid model of striatal excitotoxicity. We completed our study with quantitative analyses of BDNF protein levels and CB1 binding activity in the cortex. We show that, 2 weeks post lesion, cortical neurons contain more BDNF compared with controls and to earlier time points. Such BDNF up-regulation coincides with a higher binding activity and an increased protein expression of CB1. We suggest that after excitotoxic lesions, CB1 might, at least transiently, upregulate BDNF in the attempt to rescue striatal neurons from degeneration. ?? 2008 IBRO.},

MAGL is broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, and the contributions of different brain cell types to the regulation of 2-AG activity in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissect the cellular anatomy of MAGL-mediated 2-AG metabolism in the brain and show that neurons and astrocytes coordinately regulate 2-AG content and endocannabinoid-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and behavior. We also find that astrocytic MAGL is mainly responsible for converting 2-AG to neuroinflammatory prostaglandins via a mechanism that may involve transcellular shuttling of lipid substrates. Astrocytic-neuronal interplay thus provides distributed oversight of 2-AG metabolism and function and, through doing so, protects the nervous system from excessive CB<inf>1</inf> receptor activation and promotes endocannabinoid crosstalk with other lipid transmitter systems.},

FAAH inhibitors produce a select subset of the behavioral effects observed with CB1 agonists, which suggests a functional segregation of endocannabinoid signaling pathways in vivo. Testing this hypothesis, however, requires specific tools to independently block anandamide and 2-AG metabolism. Here, we report a potent and selective inhibitor of MAGL called JZL184 that, upon administration to mice, raises brain 2-AG by eight-fold without altering anandamide. JZL184-treated mice exhibited a broad array of CB1-dependent behavioral effects, including analgesia, hypothermia and hypomotility.

However, several studies have highlighted the implication of glial cells, and in particular astrocytes, in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease. A better understanding of the respective contributions of neurons and astrocytes in HD is needed and would be important for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Today, no comparable in vivo models expressing the mutant HTT selectively in astrocytes or in neurons are available. In this study, we developed comparable cell-type specific mouse models expressing a fragment of Huntingtin specifically in neurons, astrocytes, or in both cell populations of the adult mouse basal ganglia circuit. This approach allowed us to characterize behavioral alterations occurring as soon as 4 weeks postinjection. Interestingly, less severe but significant behavioral alterations were also observed in the two cell-type specific models. We further showed that astrocytes are less affected by mHTT compared to neurons, in particular concerning mHTT aggregation. Additionally, a more indirect contribution of astrocytes compared to neurons was observed in several pathophysiological mechanisms such as astrogliosis and neuronal dysfunction. Finally, we showed that direct and indirect transcriptional alterations within the glial glutamatergic clearing system are caused by astrocytic and neuronal expression of mHTT, respectively. We anticipate that our study will help to better understand the contributions of astrocytes to HD and guide future therapeutic efforts.},

Recent evidence suggests a strong relationship between MDD and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as well as natural processes of aging. Changes in the neuroplasticity, morphology, and neurotransmission in the brain are seem to be associated to both, MDD and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, there is evidence that psychological stress and MDD are associated with molecular and cellular signs of accelerated aging. This review will highlight the relationship between MDD, the aging process, and neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the neurochemical processes involved.},

Using the pilocarpine model of chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures, which mimics the main features of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in humans, we examined the expression of CB1R in hippocampal astrocytes of epileptic rats. Furthermore, we also examined the expression of astrocytic CB1R in the resected hippocampi from patients with medically refractory mesial TLE. Using immunofluorescent double labeling, we found increased expression of astrocytic CB1R in hippocampi of epileptic rats, whereas expression of astrocytic CB1R was not detectable in hippocampi of saline treated animals. Furthermore, CB1R was also found in some astrocytes in sclerotic hippocampi in a subset of patients with intractable mesial TLE. Detection with immune electron microscopy showed that the expression of CB1R was increased in astrocytes of epileptic rats and modest levels of CB1R were also found on the astrocytic membrane of sclerotic hippocampi. These results suggest that increased expression of astrocytic CB1R in sclerotic hippocampi might be involved in the cellular basis of the effects of cannabinoids on epilepsy.},

The present study investigates whether cannabinoids and endocannabinoid, anandamide have an effect on astroglial excitatory amino acid (EAA) transport. The kinetics of glutamate transport was studied in rat cortical astrocytes, using the radiolabeled, non-metabolized amino acid, d-[3H] aspartate in the absence or presence of cannabinoid receptor agonists. The results show that in vehicle controls the uptake of d-aspartate was rapid, sodium-dependent and saturated within the first 5 min, resulting in a Km 7.365 ?? 1.16 ??mol/L (n = 5) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) 1207 ?? 51 nmol/mg protein/min. Addition of the synthetic cannabinoid analog R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolol][1,2,3de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone (WIN 55,212-2; 3 ??mol/L) increased the Km (26.25 ?? 4.84 ??mol/L) without affecting the Vmax (1122 ?? 77 nmol/mg protein/min), suggesting the inhibition was competitive and reversible. Various other cannabinoid agonists also inhibited d-aspartate uptake in a dose-dependent and stereospecific manner. The cannabinoid inhibition of EAA transport was partially blocked by the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl-5(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A; 100 nmol/L). The inhibitory effects of WIN 55,212-2, or its endogenous counterpart anandamide were reversed by 98,059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK). These results suggest that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may constitute a novel class of inhibitors of astroglial glutamate transport system.},

Using the BACHD mice that express the full-length mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein with 97 glutamine repeats, we first demonstrated localized in vivo changes in brain glucose use reminiscent of what is observed in premanifest HD carriers. Using biochemical, molecular, and functional analyses on different primary cell culture models from BACHD mice, we observed that mHtt does not directly affect metabolic activity in a cell autonomous manner. However, coculture of neurons with astrocytes from wild-type or BACHD mice identified mutant astrocytes as a source of adverse non-cell autonomous effects on neuron energy metabolism possibly by increasing oxidative stress. These results suggest that astrocyte-to-neuron signaling is involved in early energy metabolic alterations in HD.},

The mutation of htt leads to dysfunction and premature death of striatal and cortical neurons. However, the effects of htt mutation on glia remain largely unknown. This study aimed to establish a glia HD model using an adenoviral vector to express wild-type and mutant N-terminal huntingtin fragment 1-552 amino acids (htt552) in rat primary cortical astrocytes. We have evaluated optimal conditions for the infection of astrocytes with adenoviral vectors, and the kinetics of the expression of htt552 in astrocytes. The majority of astrocytes expressed the transgene after infection. At 24 h postinfection, the highest rate of infection was 89+/-3\{%\} for the wild-type (htt552-18Q) with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 80, and the highest rate of infection was 91+/-4\{%\} for the mutant type (htt552-100Q) with the same viral dose. The duration of expression of htt552 lasted for about 7 days with a relatively high level from 1 to 4 days post-infection. Mutant huntingtin (htt552-100Q) produced the characteristic HD pathology after 3 days by the appearance of cytoplasmic aggregates and intranuclear inclusions. The result of MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] assay showed that the inhibition of viability by virus on astrocytes was also dose-dependent. To obtain high infection rate and low toxicity, the viral dose with an m.o.i. of 40 was optimal to our cell model. The present study demonstrates that adenoviral-mediated expression of mutant htt provides an advantageous system for histological and biochemical analysis of HD pathogenesis in primary cortical astrocyte cultures.},

Before embarking into physiological investigations of the yet-to-be-identified "tripartite" synapses in the basal ganglia in general and the striatum in particular, we therefore characterized anatomically the PD-related modifications in astrocytic morphology, the changes in astrocytic network connections and the consequences on the spatial relationship between astrocytic processes and asymmetric synapses in normal and PD-like conditions in experimental and human PD.

   abstract = {The endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) are lipid molecules that may mediate retrograde signaling at central synapses and other forms of short-range neuronal communication. The monoglyceride 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) meets several criteria of an endocannabinoid substance: (i) it activates cannabinoid receptors; (ii) it is produced by neurons in an activity-dependent manner; and (iii) it is rapidly eliminated. 2-AG inactivation is only partially understood, but it may occur by transport into cells and enzymatic hydrolysis. Here we tested the hypothesis that monoglyceride lipase (MGL), a serine hydrolase that converts monoglycerides to fatty acid and glycerol, participates in 2-AG inactivation. We cloned MGL by homology from a rat brain cDNA library. Its cDNA sequence encoded for a 303-aa protein with a calculated molecular weight of 33,367 daltons. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that MGL mRNA is heterogeneously expressed in the rat brain, with highest levels in regions where CB(1) cannabinoid receptors are also present (hippocampus, cortex, anterior thalamus, and cerebellum). Immunohistochemical studies in the hippocampus showed that MGL distribution has striking laminar specificity, suggesting a presynaptic localization of the enzyme. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of MGL cDNA into rat cortical neurons increased MGL expression and attenuated N-methyl-D-aspartate/carbachol-induced 2-AG accumulation in these cells. No such effect was observed on the accumulation of anandamide, another endocannabinoid lipid. The results suggest that hydrolysis by means of MGL is a primary mechanism for 2-AG inactivation in intact neurons.},

   abstract = {The probability of suffering the mood disorder depression is up to 30% in women and 15% in men during their life span. Pharmacological options for depression are limited: conventional antidepressants have low efficacy and a delayed onset of action (several weeks). Here we investigate the antidepressant actions of inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the major degradative enzyme of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. A low-dose of MAGL inhibitors produces antidepressant effects on acute stress-exposed mice, through glutamatergic synaptic long-term depression (LTD), without significant effects on chronic corticosterone-exposed mice. In contrast, a high-dose of MAGL inhibitors produces pro- or antidepressant effects on acute stress- or chronic corticosterone-exposed mice, respectively, through GABAergic synaptic disinhibition. In the hippocampus, in vivo inhibition of MAGL induces a CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R)-dependent suppression of inhibitory GABAergic synapses and an in vivo LTD of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. LTD induction requires CB1R in astroglial cells (but not in GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons) and postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The conventional antidepressant fluoxetine produces rapid or delayed antidepressant effects in acute stress- or chronic corticosterone-exposed mice, respectively. We propose that depression-like behavior of animals in response to acute stress is the normal behavioral response, and thus, MAGL inhibitors, which produce antidepressant effects in chronic corticosterone-exposed animals through GABAergic synaptic disinhibition, represent a new class of rapidly-acting and long-lasting antidepressants.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 22 March 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.22.},

   abstract = {Astrocytes are integral functional components of synapses, regulating transmission and plasticity. They have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, although their precise roles have not been comprehensively characterized. Astrocytes integrate activity from neighboring synapses by responding to neuronally released neurotransmitters such as glutamate and ATP. Strong activation of astrocytes mediated by these neurotransmitters can promote seizure-like activity by initiating a positive feedback loop that induces excessive neuronal discharge. Recent work has demonstrated that astrocytes express cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, which are sensitive to endocannabinoids released by nearby pyramidal cells. In this study, we tested whether this mechanism also contributes to epileptiform activity. In a model of 4-aminopyridine induced epileptic-like activity in hippocampal slice cultures, we show that pharmacological blockade of astrocyte CB1 receptors did not modify the initiation, but significantly reduced the maintenance of epileptiform discharge. When communication in astrocytic networks was disrupted by chelating astrocytic calcium, this CB1 receptor-mediated modulation of epileptiform activity was no longer observed. Thus, endocannabinoid signaling from neurons to astrocytes represents an additional significant factor in the maintenance of epileptiform activity in the hippocampus.},

   abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the protein huntingtin and is characterized by selective neurodegeneration that preferentially occurs in striatal medium spiny neurons. Because the medium spiny neurons are innervated abundantly by glutamatergic axons from cortical neurons, the preferential degeneration in the striatal neurons supports the glutamate excitotoxicity theory for HD pathogenesis. Thus, glutamate uptake by glia may be particularly important for preventing glutamate excitotoxicity in HD. Although mutant huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously in various types of cells, it accumulates and forms aggregates in fewer glial cells than in neuronal cells. It remains largely unknown whether and how mutant huntingtin in glia can contribute to the neurological symptoms of HD. We generated transgenic mice that express N-terminal mutant huntingtin in astrocytes, a major type of glial cell that remove extracellular glutamate in the brain. Although transgenic mutant huntingtin in astrocytes is expressed below the endogenous level, it can cause age-dependent neurological phenotypes in transgenic mice. Mice expressing mutant huntingtin show body weight loss, have motor function deficits, and die earlier than wild-type or control transgenic mice. We also found that mutant huntingtin in astrocytes decreases the expression of glutamate transporter by increasing its binding to Sp1 and reducing the association of Sp1 with the promoter of glutamate transporter. These results imply an important role for glial mutant huntingtin in HD pathology and suggest possibilities for treatment.},

   abstract = {Type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) and leptin (ObR) receptors regulate metabolic and astroglial functions, but the potential links between the two systems in astrocytes were not investigated so far. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of CB1 receptor expression and activity in cultured cortical and hypothalamic astrocytes demonstrated that cannabinoid signaling controls the levels of ObR expression. Lack of CB1 receptors also markedly impaired leptin-mediated activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and 5 (STAT3 and STAT5) in astrocytes. In particular, CB1 deletion determined a basal overactivation of STAT5, thereby leading to the downregulation of ObR expression, and leptin failed to regulate STAT5-dependent glycogen storage in the absence of CB1 receptors. These results show that CB1 receptors directly interfere with leptin signaling and its ability to regulate glycogen storage, thereby representing a novel mechanism linking endocannabinoid and leptin signaling in the regulation of brain energy storage and neuronal functions. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

We measured the endogenous content of N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoylglycerol and the activity of their biosynthetic enzymes (N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D and diacylglycerol lipase, respectively) and hydrolytic enzymes [fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase, respectively] and of their target receptors (type 1 cannabinoid receptor, type 2 cannabinoid receptor, and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1) in the brains of wild-type and R6/2 mice of different ages, as well as in the striatum and cortex of 12-week-old animals. In addition, we measured FAAH activity in lymphocytes of R6/2 mice. In the whole brains of 12-week-old R6/2 mice, we found reductions in N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D activity, diacylglycerol lipase activity and cannabinoid receptor binding, mostly associated with changes in the striatum but not in the cortex, as well as an increase in 2-arachidonoylglycerol content as compared with wild-type littermates, without any other change in ECS elements. Then, our analysis was extended to HD43 cells, an inducible cellular model of HD derived from rat ST14A cells. In both induced and noninduced conditions, we demonstrated a fully functional ECS. Overall, our data suggest that the ECS is differently affected in mouse and human HD, and that HD43 cells are suitable for high-throughput screening of FAAH-oriented drugs affecting HD progression.},

   abstract = {The cannabinoid CB2 receptor, which is activated by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), protects striatal neurons from apoptotic death caused by the local administration of malonate, a rat model of Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study, we investigated whether endocannabinoids provide tonic neuroprotection in this HD model, by examining the effect of O-3841, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipases, the enzymes that catalyse 2-AG biosynthesis, and JZL184 or OMDM169, two inhibitors of 2-AG inactivation by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). The inhibitors were injected in rats with the striatum lesioned with malonate, and several biochemical and morphological parameters were measured in this brain area. Similar experiments were also conducted in vitro in cultured M-213 cells, which have the phenotypic characteristics of striatal neurons. O-3841 produced a significant reduction in the striatal levels of 2-AG in animals lesioned with malonate. However, surprisingly, the inhibitor attenuated malonate-induced GABA and BDNF deficiencies and the reduction in Nissl staining, as well as the increase in GFAP immunostaining. In contrast, JZL184 exacerbated malonate-induced striatal damage. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was induced in the striatum 24 h after the lesion simultaneously with other pro-inflammatory responses. The COX-2-derived 2-AG metabolite, prostaglandin E2 glyceryl ester (PGE2-G), exacerbated neurotoxicity, and this effect was antagonized by the blockade of PGE2-G action with AGN220675. In M-213 cells exposed to malonate, in which COX-2 was also upregulated, JZL184 worsened neurotoxicity, and this effect was attenuated by the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib or AGN220675. OMDM169 also worsened neurotoxicity and produced measurable levels of PGE2-G. In conclusion, the inhibition of 2-AG biosynthesis is neuroprotective in rats lesioned with malonate, possibly through the counteraction of the formation of pro-neuroinflammatory PGE2-G, formed from COX-2-mediated oxygenation of 2-AG. Accordingly, MAGL inhibition or the administration of PGE2-G aggravates the malonate toxicity.},

Here we investigated CB1 receptor regulation of glutamate release and uptake and synaptic transmission in the rat striatum. We show that CB1 receptor activation reduces both the release and uptake of [3H]glutamate in striatal slices. We also demonstrate that both activation of CB1 receptors and inhibition of glutamate uptake reduce corticostriatal synaptic transmission in a mutually occlusive manner and that both forms of depression are dependent on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. We propose that CB1 receptor activation in the striatum decreases glutamate transporter activity and that the resulting increase in synaptic cleft glutamate concentration causes the activation of presynaptic mGluRs, which then decrease glutamate release.},

This system regulates a plethora of physiological functions and is composed of cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and the enzymes involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids. In this review, we highlight the new advances in cannabinoid signaling, focusing on a key component of the ECS, the type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1). In recent years, the development of new imaging and molecular tools has demonstrated that this receptor can be distributed in many cell types (e.g., neuronal or glial cells) and intracellular compartments (e.g., mitochondria). Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects are differentially mediated by CB 1 receptors according to their specific localization (e.g., glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons). Moreover, this receptor is expressed in the periphery, where it can modulate periphery-brain connections. Finally, the better understanding of the CB 1 receptor structure led researchers to propose interesting and new allosteric modulators. Thus, the advances and the new directions of the CB 1 receptor field will provide new insights and better approaches to profit from its interesting therapeutic profile.},

In the present study, we investigated the 2-AG signaling system at mossy cell (MC)GÇôgranule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse dentate gyrus, an excitatory recurrent circuit where endocannabinoids are thought to suppress epileptogenesis. First, we showed by electrophysiology that 2-AG produced by diacylglycerol lipase +¦ (DGL+¦) mediated both depolarization-induced suppression of excitation and its enhancement by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor activation at MCGÇôGC synapses, as they were abolished in DGL+¦-knock-out mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that DGL+¦ was enriched in the neck portion of GC spines forming synapses with MC terminals, whereas cannabinoid CB1 receptors accumulated in the terminal portion of MC axons. On the other hand, the major 2-AG-degrading enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), was absent at MCGÇôGC synapses but was expressed in astrocytes and some inhibitory terminals. Serial electron microscopy clarified that a given GC spine was innervated by a single MC terminal and also contacted nonsynaptically by other MC terminals making synapses with other GC spines in the neighborhood. MGL-expressing elements, however, poorly covered GC spines, amounting to 17% of the total surface of GC spines by astrocytes and 4% by inhibitory terminals. Our findings provide a basis for 2-AG-mediated retrograde suppression of MCGÇôGC synaptic transmission and also suggest that 2-AG released from activated GC spines is readily accessible to nearby MCGÇôGC synapses by escaping from enzymatic degradation. This molecularGÇôanatomical configuration will contribute to adjust network activity in the dentate gyrus after enhanced excitation},

Cannabinoid CB1 receptor is expressed in neuronal mitochondrial membranes (mtCB1R) and involved in regulating mitochondrial functions under physiological conditions. However, whether mtCB1R affords neuroprotection against I/R injury remains unknown. We used mouse models of cerebral I/R, primary cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and Ca(2+)-induced injury in purified neuronal mitochondria to investigate the role of mtCB1R in neuroprotection. Our results showed selective cell-permeant CB1 receptor agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA), significantly up-regulated the expression of mtCB1R protein in hippocampal neurons and tissue. In vitro, ACEA restored cell viability, inhibited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and reduced apoptosis, improved mitochondrial function. In vivo, ACEA ameliorated neurological scores, diminished the number of TUNEL-positive neurons and decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3. However, ACEA-induced benefits were blocked by the selective cell-permeant CB1 receptor antagonist AM251, but just partially by the selective cell-impermeant CB1 receptor antagonist hemopressin. In purified neuronal mitochondria, mtCB1R activation attenuated Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial injury. In conclusion, mtCB1R is involved in ACEA-induced protective effects on neurons and mitochondrial functions, suggesting mtCB1R may be a potential novel target for the treatment of brain ischemic injury.},

Classically, this enzyme is upregulated in inflammatory situations and is responsible for the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid (AA). One lesser-known property of COX-2 is its ability to metabolize the endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Endocannabinoid metabolism by COX-2 is not merely a means to terminate their actions. On the contrary, it generates PG analogs, namely PG-glycerol esters (PG-G) for 2-AG and PG-ethanolamides (PG-EA or prostamides) for AEA. Although the formation of these COX-2-derived metabolites of the endocannabinoids has been known for a while, their biological effects remain to be fully elucidated. Recently, several studies have focused on the role of these PG-G or PG-EA in vivo.

   abstract = {The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed at high levels in the striatum. Activation of CB 1 increases expression of neuronal trophic factors and inhibits neurotransmitter release from GABA-ergic striatal neurons. CB1 mRNA levels can be elevated by treatment with cannabinoids in non-neuronal cells. We wanted to determine whether cannabinoid treatment could induce CB1 expression in a cell culture model of striatal neurons and, if possible, determine the molecular mechanism by which this occurred. We found that treatment of STHdh7/7 cells with the cannabinoids ACEA, mAEA, and AEA produced a CB1receptor- dependent increase in CB1 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression. This response was Akt- and NF-kB-dependent. Because decreased CB1 expression is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), we wanted to determine whether cannabinoids could increase CB1 expression in STHdh7/111 and 111/111 cells expressing the mutant huntingtin protein. We observed that cannabinoid treatment increased CB1 mRNA levels approximately 10-fold in STHdh7/111 and 111/111 cells, compared to vehicle treatment. Importantly, cannabinoid treatment improved ATP production, increased the expression of the trophic factor BDNF-2, and the mitochondrial regulator PGC1??, and reduced spontaneous GABA release, in HD cells. Therefore, cannabinoid-mediated increases in CB1 levels could reduce the severity of some molecular pathologies observed in HD. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These benefits not only include the alleviation of specific motor symptoms [e.g. choreic movements with cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1))/transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 agonists in HD; bradykinesia with CB(1) antagonists and tremor with CB(1) agonists in PD], but also the delay of disease progression due to the neuroprotective properties demonstrated for cannabinoids (e.g. CB(1) agonists reduce excitotoxicity; CB(2) agonists limit the toxicity of reactive microglia; and antioxidant cannabinoids attenuate oxidative damage). In addition, extensive biochemical, anatomical, physiological and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that: (i) the different elements of the cannabinoid system are abundant in basal ganglia structures and they are affected by these disorders; (ii) the cannabinoid system plays a prominent role in basal ganglia function by modulating the neurotransmitters that operate in the basal ganglia circuits, both in healthy and pathological conditions; and (iii) the activation and/or inhibition of the cannabinoid system is associated with important motor responses that are maintained and even enhanced in conditions of malfunctioning and/or degeneration. In this article we will review the available data regarding the relationship between the cannabinoid system and basal ganglia activity, both in healthy and pathological conditions and will also try to identify future lines of research expected to increase current knowledge about the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting this system in PD, HD and other basal ganglia disorders.},

While protein synthesis is crucial for the consolidation of postsynaptic plasticity, whether and how protein synthesis regulates presynaptic plasticity in the mature mammalian brain remain unclear. Here, using paired whole-cell recordings in rodent hippocampal slices, we report that presynaptic protein synthesis is required for long-term, but not short-term, plasticity of GABA release from type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1)-expressing axons. This long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD) involves cap-dependent protein synthesis in presynaptic interneuron axons, but not somata. Translation is required during the induction, but not maintenance, of iLTD. Mechanistically, CB1 activation enhances protein synthesis via the mTOR??pathway. Furthermore, using super-resolution STORM microscopy, we revealed eukaryotic ribosomes in CB1-expressing axon terminals. These findings suggest that presynaptic local protein synthesis controls neurotransmitter release during long-term plasticity in the mature mammalian brain.},

Here, by using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we investigated whether the levels of three endogenous neuroprotective substances, the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), are altered in different brain areas of transgenic R6/2 versus wild-type (WT) mice at two different disease phases, i.e. in pre-symptomatic (4.5 weeks) or overtly symptomatic (10 weeks) R6/2 mice versus age-matched WT mice (n = 4/group). Except for a ???25% decrease in 2-AG levels in the cortex, no significant changes in endocannabinoid and PEA levels were observed in pre-symptomatic R6/2 versus WT mice. By contrast, in symptomatic R6/2 mice the levels of all three compounds were significantly (???30-60%) decreased in the striatum, whereas little changes were observed in the hippocampus, and a ???28% decrease of 2-AG levels, accompanied by a ???50% increase of AEA levels, was found in the cortex. These findings show that endocannabinoid levels change in a disease phase- and region-specific way in the brain of R6/2 mice and indicate that an impaired endocannabinoid system is a hallmark of symptomatic HD, thus suggesting that drugs inhibiting endocannabinoid degradation might be used to treat this disease. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Cannabinoids and opioids are widely consumed drugs of abuse that produce motor depression, in part via respective activation of the cannabinoid subtype 1 receptor (CB1R) and the mu-opioid receptor (muOR), in the striatal circuitry originating in the caudate putamen nucleus (CPN). Thus, the CB1R and muOR may show similar targeting in the CPN. To test this hypothesis, we examined the electron microscopic immunocytochemical labeling of CB1R and muOR in CPN patches of rat brain. Of the CB1R-labeled profiles, 34% (588) were dendrites, presumably arising from spiny as well as aspiny-type somata, which also contained CB1R immunoreactivity. In dendrites, CB1R often was localized to nonsynaptic and synaptic plasma membranes, particularly near asymmetric excitatory-type junctions. Almost one-half of the CB1R-labeled dendrites contained muOR immunoreactivity, whereas only 20% of all muOR-labeled dendrites expressed CB1R. Axons and axon terminals as well as abundant glial processes also showed plasmalemmal CB1R and were mainly without muOR immunoreactivity. Many CB1R-labeled axon terminals were small and without recognizable synaptic junctions, but a few also formed asymmetric, or more rarely symmetric, synapses. The CB1R-labeled glial processes were often perivascular or perisynaptic, surrounding asymmetric excitatory-type axospinous synapses. Our results show that in CPN patches CB1R and muOR are targeted strategically to some of the same postsynaptic neurons, which may account for certain similarities in motor function. Furthermore, they also provide evidence that CB1R may play a major role in the modulation of presynaptic transmitter release and glial functions that are unaffected in large part by opioids active at muOR in CPN.},

Astrocytes display an array of receptors involved in innate immunity, including Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, scavenger receptors, mannose receptor and components of the complement system. Following activation, astrocytes are endowed with the ability to secrete soluble mediators, such as CXCL10, CCL2, interleukin-6 and BAFF, which have an impact on both innate and adaptive immune responses. The role of astrocytes in inflammation and tissue repair is elaborated by recent in vivo studies employing cell-type specific gene targeting. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To date, the pathogenesis of NDDs is still poorly understood and effective disease-modifying therapies for NDDs have not been established. NDDs share the common morphological characteristic of the deposition of abnormal proteins in the nervous system, including neurons. Autophagy is one of the major processes by which damaged organelles and abnormal proteins are removed from cells. Impairment of autophagy has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs, and the regulation of autophagy may become a therapeutic strategy for NDDs. In recent years, some active compounds from plants have been found to regulate autophagy and exert neuroprotection against NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia 3, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, via activating autophagy. In this paper, we review recent advances in the use of active ingredients from plants for the regulation of autophagy and treatment of NDDs.},

   abstract = {This Editorial highlights a study by Chiodi et al. () showing that the effects mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) activation in the striatum are significantly reduced in rats with neuronal over-expression of adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR). Two hypotheses are derived from that study. Hypothesis A: two subpopulations of pre-synaptic CB1R in corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals exist, one forming and another not forming heteromers with A2AR. Hypothesis B: CB1R are predominantly forming heteromers with A2AR. In the case of hypothesis A, the A2AR might be required for CB1R-A2AR heteromeric signaling, whereas non-heteromeric CB1R activity is inhibited by A2ARs. In the case of hypothesis B, up-regulation of A2ARs may perturb heteromeric stoichiometry, thus reducing CB1R functioning. In any case, pre-synaptic striatal A2AR-CB1R heteromers emerge as important targets of the effects of cannabinoids demonstrated at the neuronal and behavioral level.

   abstract = {The main pharmacological effects of marijuana, as well as synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids, are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. The CB(1) receptor is the major cannabinoid receptor in the central nervous system and has gained increasing interest as a target for drug discovery for treatment of nausea, cachexia, obesity, pain, spasticity, neurodegenerative diseases and mood and substance abuse disorders. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that CB(1) receptors, like other GPCRs, interact with and are regulated by several other proteins beyond the established role of heterotrimeric G-proteins. These proteins, which include the GPCR kinases, beta-arrestins, GPCR-associated sorting proteins, factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase, other GPCRs (heterodimerization) and the novel cannabinoid receptor-interacting proteins: CRIP(1a/b), are thought to play important roles in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, desensitization, down-regulation, signal transduction and constitutive activity of CB(1) receptors. This review examines CB(1) receptor-interacting proteins, including heterotrimeric G-proteins, but with particular emphasis on non-G-protein entities, that might comprise the CB(1) receptosomal complex. The evidence for direct interaction with CB(1) receptors and potential functional roles of these interacting proteins is discussed, as are future directions and challenges in this field with an emphasis on the possibility of eventually targeting these proteins for drug discovery.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the expansion of a glutamine repeat (polyQ) in the N-terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein. Expression of polyQ-containing proteins has been previously shown to induce various cellular stress responses. Among these, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade has been observed in cellular models of HD. However, the implication of the JNK pathway has not previously been evaluated in the striatum of HD animal models. Here we report that the JNK pathway participates in HD pathology in a rat model of the disease. Increased phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun was observed as early as 4 weeks and persisted for 13 weeks after lentiviral-mediated expression of htt171-82Q. In order to assess the importance of this pathway in HD pathology, JNK inhibitors including dominant-negative mutants of upstream kinases (ASK1K709R, MEKK1D1369A), a c-Jun mutant (Δ169c-Jun) and the active domain of the scaffold protein JIP-1/IBI (IBI-JBD) were tested for their ability to mitigate the effect of htt171-82Q. The overexpression of MEKK1D1369A and JIP-1/IBI reduced the polyQ-related loss of DARPP-32 expression, while the other inhibitors had no effect. In all cases, the formation of EM48-positive htt inclusions and P-c-Jun immunoreactivity were unaltered. These results suggest that JNK activation is involved in HD and that blockade of this pathway may be of benefit in counteracting HD-related neurotoxicity. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Altered glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling has been proposed as contributing to the specific striatal cell death observed in Huntington's disease (HD). However, the precise mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin sensitize striatal cells to dopamine and glutamate inputs remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in knock-in HD striatal cells that mutant huntingtin enhances dopamine-mediated striatal cell death via dopamine D(1) receptors. Moreover, we show that NMDA receptors specifically potentiate the vulnerability of mutant huntingtin striatal cells to dopamine toxicity as pretreatment with NMDA increased D(1)R-induced cell death in mutant but not wild-type cells. As potential underlying mechanism of increased striatal vulnerability, we identified aberrant cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activation. We demonstrate that enhanced Cdk5 phosphorylation and increased calpain-mediated conversion of the Cdk5 activator p35 into p25 may account for the deregulation of Cdk5 associated to dopamine and glutamate receptor activation in knock-in HD striatal cells. Moreover, supporting a detrimental role of Cdk5 in striatal cell death, neuronal loss can be widely prevented by roscovitine, a potent Cdk5 inhibitor. Significantly, reduced Cdk5 expression together with enhanced Cdk5 phosphorylation and p25 accumulation also occurs in the striatum of mutant Hdh(Q111) mice and HD human brain suggesting the relevance of deregulated Cdk5 pathway in HD pathology. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of striatal cells in HD and identify p25/Cdk5 as an important mediator of dopamine and glutamate neurotoxicity associated to HD.},

The recently identified cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein 1a (Cnrip1a, CRIP1a) binds to the C-terminal domain of CB1R, a region known to be important for receptor desensitization and internalization. Evidence that CRIP1a and CB1R interact in vivo has been reported, but the neuroanatomical distribution of CRIP1a is unknown. Moreover, while alterations of hippocampal CRIP1a levels following limbic seizures indicate a role in controlling excessive neuronal activity, the physiological function of CRIP1a in vivo has not been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of CRIP1a in the hippocampus and examined CRIP1a as a potential modulator of CB1R signaling. We found that Cnrip1a mRNA is co-expressed with Cnr1 mRNA in pyramidal neurons and interneurons of the hippocampal formation. CRIP1a protein profiles were largely segregated from CB1R profiles in mossy cell terminals but not in hippocampal CA1 region. CB1R activation induced relocalization to close proximity with CRIP1a. Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of CRIP1a specifically in the hippocampus revealed that CRIP1a modulates CB1R activity by enhancing cannabinoid-induced G protein activation. CRIP1a overexpression extended the depression of excitatory currents by cannabinoids in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and diminished the severity of chemically induced acute epileptiform seizures. Collectively, our data indicate that CRIP1a enhances hippocampal CB1R signaling in vivo.},

As this motif is different in the two CBR subtypes, we mutated lysine 402 of CB(1)R into glycine, to obtain a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid sequence and consensus similar to that of CB(2)R. Both mutated and wild-type receptors were transiently expressed in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, and their localization and functioning were investigated using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence labelling. We found a reduced propensity of the mutant CB(1)R to reside in cholesterol-rich microdomains and, by means of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we documented its loss of sensitivity to increased membrane cholesterol content. These results seem to uncover the existence of a new structural determinant in cannabinoid receptors, that is likely implicated in directing their interaction with cholesterol-rich microdomains of cell membranes.},

   abstract = {1. The striatum is a crucial site of action for the motor effects of cannabinoids (CBs). However, the electrophysiological consequences of activation of CB receptors on the striatal neurons have not been established. Here we report fur the first time that the cannabimimetic aminoalkylindole WIN 55,212-2 and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide substantially depress corticostriatal glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto striatal neurons in the brain slice preparation. The selective CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 effectively reversed this inhibition. 2. WIN 55,212-2 significantly increased the paired-pulse facilitation of synaptically evoked EPSCs, while having no effect on the sensitivity of postsynaptic neurons to alpha -amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid. WIN 55,212-2 also reduced the frequency of spontaneous, action potential-dependent EPSCs (sEPSCs) without altering their amplitude distribution. 3. Superfusion of WIN 55,212-2 elicited a membrane hyperpolarization accompanied by a decrease in input resistance. Both effects were blocked by intracellular caesium. In contrast, intracellular caesium failed to affect WIN 55,212- 2-mediated synaptic inhibition. 4. The WIN 55,212-2-mediated synaptic inhibition was blocked by the G(i/o) protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX), but not by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline or GABA(B) receptor antagonist SCH 50911. 5. Pretreatment with the N-type Ca2+ channel antagonist omega -conotoxin GVIA selectively abolished the WIN-55,212-2- mediated synaptic inhibition. 6. These results suggest that; cannabinoids depress the corticostriatal glutamatergic synaptic transmission through the activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors to inhibit N-type Ca2+ channel activity, which in turn reduces glutamate release. The presynaptic action of cannabinoids is mediated by a PTX-sensitive G(i/o) protein- coupled signalling pathway.},

However, whether and how D1Rs and PKA regulate neuronal excitability and behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we developed a phosphoproteomic analysis method to identify known and novel PKA substrates downstream of the D1R and obtained more than 100 candidate substrates, including Rap1 GEF (Rasgrp2). We found that PKA phosphorylation of Rasgrp2 activated its guanine nucleotide-exchange activity on Rap1. Cocaine exposure activated Rap1 in the nucleus accumbens in mice. The expression of constitutively active PKA or Rap1 in accumbal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) enhanced neuronal firing rates and behavioral responses to cocaine exposure through MAPK. Knockout of Rap1 in the accumbal D1R-MSNs was sufficient to decrease these phenotypes. These findings demonstrate a novel DA-PKA-Rap1-MAPK intracellular signaling mechanism in D1R-MSNs that increases neuronal excitability to enhance reward-related behaviors. Nagai et al. identified more than 100 candidate substrates of PKA downstream of dopamine receptor D1R by a kinase-oriented phosphoproteomic analysis and demonstrated a novel DA-PKA-Rap1-MAPK intracellular signaling mechanism in D1R-MSNs which increases neuronal excitability to enhance reward-related behaviors.},

   abstract = {Recessive mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the interaction between endocannabinoid (eCB) and dopaminergic transmission at corticostriatal synapses in PINK1 deficient mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp and conventional recordings of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were made from slices of PINK1-/-, heterozygous PINK1+/- mice and wild-type littermates (PINK1+/+). In PINK1+/+ mice, CB1 receptor (CB1R) activation reduced spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). Likewise, CB1R agonists (ACEA, WIN55,212-3 and HU210) induced a dose-dependent reduction of cortically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (eEPSP) amplitude. While CB1R agonists retained their inhibitory effect in heterozygous PINK1+/- mice, conversely, in PINK1-/- mice they failed to modulate sEPSC amplitude. Similarly, CB1R activation failed to reduce eEPSP amplitude in PINK1-/- mice. Parallel biochemical measurements revealed no significant difference in the levels of the two main eCBs, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA) in PINK1-/- striata. Similarly, no change was observed in the enzymatic activity of both fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), responsible for eCB hydrolysis. Instead, a significant reduction of binding ability of CB1R agonists was found in PINK1-/- mice. Notably, the CB1R-dependent inhibition of synaptic activity was restored either by amphetamine or after chronic treatment with the D2 dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole. Additionally, CB1R binding activity returned to control levels after chronic pretreatment with quinpirole. Consistent with the hypothesis of a close interplay with dopaminergic neurotransmission, our findings show a CB1R dysfunction at corticostriatal synapses in PINK1-/-, but not in PINK1+/- mice, and provide a mechanistic link to the distinct plasticity deficits observed in both genotypes.},

   abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Prior to motor symptom onset or neuronal cell loss in HD, levels of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) decrease in the basal ganglia. Decreasing CB1 levels are strongly correlated with chorea and cognitive deficit. CB1 agonists are functionally selective (biased) for divergent signaling pathways. In this study, six cannabinoids were tested for signaling bias in in vitro models of medium spiny projection neurons expressing wild-type (STHdhQ7/Q7)or mutant huntingtin protein (STHdhQ111/Q111). Signaling bias was assessed using the Black and Leff operational model. Relative activity [DlogR (t/KA)] and system bias (DDlogR) were calculated relative to the reference compound WIN55,212-2 for Gai/o,Gas, Gaq,Gbg, and b-arrestin1 signaling following treatment with 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), anandamide (AEA), CP55,940, D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and THC1CBD (1:1), and compared between wild-type and HD cells. The Emax of Gai/o-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling was 50% lower in HD cells compared with wild-type cells. 2-AG and AEA displayed Gai/o/Gbg bias and normalized CB1 protein levels and improved cell viability, whereas CP55,940 and THC displayed b-arrestin1 bias and reduced CB1 protein levels and cell viability in HD cells. CBD was not a CB1 agonist but inhibited THC-dependent signaling (THC1CBD). Therefore, enhancing Gai/o-biased endocannabinoid signaling may be therapeutically beneficial in HD. In contrast, cannabinoids that are b-arrestin-biased—such as THC found at high levels in modern varieties of marijuana—may be detrimental to CB1 signaling, particularly in HD where CB1 levels are already reduced.},

   abstract = {Synaptic communication is a dynamic process that is key to the regulation of neuronal excitability and information processing in the brain. To date, however, the molecular signals controlling synaptic dynamics have been poorly understood. Membrane-derived bioactive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term tuning of synaptic signaling, a plastic event essential for information processing at both the cellular and neuronal network levels in the brain. Here, we showed that phospholipids affect excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. Signaling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) evoked rapid and reversible depression of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. At excitatory synapses, LPA-induced depression depended on LPA1/Gαi/o-protein/phospholipase C/myosin light chain kinase cascade at the presynaptic site. LPA increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is known to trigger actomyosin contraction, and reduced the number of synaptic vesicles docked to active zones in excitatory boutons. At inhibitory synapses, postsynaptic LPA signaling led to dephosphorylation, and internalization of the GABAAγ2 subunit through the LPA1/Gα12/13-protein/RhoA/Rho kinase/calcineurin pathway. However, LPA-induced depression of GABAergic transmission was correlated with an endocytosis-independent reduction of GABAA receptors, possibly by GABAAγ2 dephosphorylation and subsequent increased lateral diffusion. Furthermore, endogenous LPA signaling, mainly via LPA1, mediated activity-dependent inhibitory depression in a model of experimental synaptic plasticity. Finally, LPA signaling, most likely restraining the excitatory drive incoming to motoneurons, regulated performance of motor output commands, a basic brain processing task. We propose that lysophospholipids serve as potential local messengers that tune synaptic strength to precedent activity of the neuron.},

Thus, the ERK cascade may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this currently untreatable disorder. HD is caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin (Htt) protein that actuates a diverse set of pathogenic mechanisms. In response to mutant Htt, ERK is activated and directs a protective transcriptional response and inhibits caspase activation. Paradoxically, Htt also interferes with several signaling events of the ERK pathway. Mutant Htt compromises the ERK-dependent transcriptional response to corticostriatal BDNF signaling. Mutant Htt also hinders glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft by down-regulating ERK-dependent expression of glutamate transporters, leaving cells vulnerable to excitotoxicity. Some of this cellular complexity can be capitalized on to achieve selective activation of ERK, which can be protective.},

   abstract = {We previously demonstrated that sodium butyrate is neuroprotective in Huntington's disease (HD) mice and that this therapeutic effect is associated with increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase/dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (MKP-1/DUSP1). Here we show that enhancing MKP-1 expression is sufficient to achieve neuroprotection in lentiviral models of HD. Wild-type MKP-1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis in primary striatal neurons exposed to an N-terminal fragment of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (Htt171-82Q), blocking caspase-3 activation and significantly reducing neuronal cell death. This neuroprotective effect of MKP-1 was demonstrated to be dependent on its enzymatic activity, being ablated by mutation of its phosphatase domain and being attributed to inhibition of specific MAP kinases (MAPKs). Overexpression of MKP-1 prevented the polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation was not altered by either polyglutamine-expanded Htt or MKP-1. Moreover, mutants of MKP-1 that selectively prevented p38 or JNK binding confirmed the important dual contributions of p38 and JNK regulation to MKP-1-mediated neuroprotection. These results demonstrate additive effects of p38 and JNK MAPK inhibition by MKP-1 without consequence to ERK activation in this striatal neuron-based paradigm. MKP-1 also provided neuroprotection in vivo in a lentiviral model of HD neuropathology in rat striatum. Together, these data extend previous evidence that JNK- and p38-mediated pathways contribute to HD pathogenesis and, importantly, show that therapies simultaneously inhibiting both JNK and p38 signaling pathways may lead to improved neuroprotective outcomes.},

One major form of striatal plasticity, long-term depression (LTD), has long appeared to be expressed only pre-synaptically. Contrary to this view, nitric oxide (NO) generated by striatal interneurons was found to induce a post-synaptically expressed form of LTD at SPN glutamatergic synapses. This form of LTD was dependent on signaling through guanylyl cyclase and protein kinase G, both of which are abundantly expressed by SPNs. NO-LTD was unaffected by local synaptic activity or antagonism of endocannabinoid (eCb) and dopamine receptors, all of which modulate canonical, pre-synaptic LTD. Moreover, NO signaling disrupted induction of this canonical LTD by inhibiting dendritic Ca2+ channels regulating eCb synthesis. These results establish an interneuron-dependent, heterosynaptic form of post-synaptic LTD that could act to promote stability of the striatal network during learning.},

Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the best-studied members of this class of lipid mediators, and it is now widely accepted that their in vivo concentration and biological activity are largely dependent on a "metabolic control." Therefore, the proteins that synthesize, transport and degrade endocannabinoids, and that together with the target receptors form the so-called "endocannabinoid system," are the focus of intense research. This new system will be presented in this review, in order to put in a better perspective the impact of its modulation on Huntington's disease. In particular, the effect of agonists/antagonists of endocannabinoid receptors, or of inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism, will be discussed in the context of onset and progression of Huntington's disease, and will be compared with other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis. Also the plastic changes of endocannabinoids in multiple sclerosis will be reviewed, as a paradigm of their impact in neuroinflammatory disorders. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These are Cesamet (nabilone), Marinol (dronabinol; Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol) and Sativex (Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol with cannabidiol). The first two of these medicines can be prescribed to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Marinol can also be prescribed to stimulate appetite, while Sativex is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adults with multiple sclerosis and as an adjunctive analgesic treatment for adult patients with advanced cancer. One challenge now is to identify additional therapeutic targets for cannabinoid receptor agonists, and a number of potential clinical applications for such agonists are mentioned in this review. A second challenge is to develop strategies that will improve the efficacy and/or the benefit-to-risk ratio of a cannabinoid receptor agonist. This review focuses on five strategies that have the potential to meet either or both of these objectives. These are strategies that involve: (i) targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside the blood-brain barrier; (ii) targeting cannabinoid receptors expressed by a particular tissue; (iii) targeting up-regulated cannabinoid receptors; (iv) targeting cannabinoid CB(2) receptors; or (v) 'multi-targeting'. Preclinical data that justify additional research directed at evaluating the clinical importance of each of these strategies are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids (eCB) are key regulators of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission at cannabinoid-1-receptor (CB1 R)-expressing axon terminals. The most abundant eCB in the brain, that is 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is hydrolyzed by the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), whose chronic inhibition in the brain was reported to cause CB1 R desensitization. We employed the MAGL knock-out mouse (MAGL-/-), a genetic model of congenital and sustained elevation of 2-AG levels in the brain, to provide morphological and biochemical evidence for beta-arrestin2-mediated CB1 R desensitization in brain regions involved in the control of emotional states, that is, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellar cortex. We found a widespread CB1 R/beta-arrestin2 co-expression in the mPFC, amygdala and hippocampus accompanied by impairment of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and elevation of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT1) at CB1 R-positive excitatory terminals in the mPFC, or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) at CB1 R-positive inhibitory terminals in the amygdala and hippocampus. The impairment of CB1 R signaling in MAGL-/- mice was also accompanied by enhanced excitatory drive in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-mPFC circuit, with subsequent elevation of glutamate release to the mPFC and anxiety-like and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, as assessed by the light/dark box and marble burying tests, respectively. Collectively, these data provide evidence for a beta-arrestin2-mediated desensitization of CB1 R in MAGL-/- mice, with impact on the synaptic plasticity of brain circuits involved in emotional functions. In this study, the authors provide evidence that congenitally enhanced endocannabinoid levels in the neuronal circuits underlying anxiety-like behavioral states (mainly medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus) lead to CB1R desenistization and anxiety and depression. MAGL-/- mice, a model of congenital overactivity of the eCB system, exhibited a compensatory impairment of CB1R signaling in anxiety-associated brain areas and a subsequent change in excitatory/inhibitory tone associated with altered score in the marble burying and light/dark box test, in concomitance with anxiety and depression behavior states. These findings may have potential relevance to the understanding of the neurochemical effects of chronic CB1R overstimulation in cannabis abusers.},

The pharmacological effect of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597, which limits the endocannabinoid degradation, was investigated in the present study. Cell proliferation (phospho-H3(+) or BrdU(+) cells) of the main adult neurogenic zones as well as apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3(+)), astroglia (GFAP(+)), and microglia (Iba1(+) cells) were analyzed in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum of rats intraperitoneally treated with URB597 (0.3 mg/kg/day) at one dose/4-days resting or 5 doses (1 dose/day). Repeated URB597 treatment increased the plasma levels of the N-acylethanolamines oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide and arachidonoylethanolamine, reduced the plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, and induced a transitory body weight decrease. The hippocampi of repeated URB597-treated rats showed a reduced number of phospho-H3(+) and BrdU(+) subgranular cells as well as GFAP(+), Iba1(+) and cleaved caspase-3(+) cells, which was accompanied with decreased hippocampal expression of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor gene Cnr1 and Faah. In the hypothalami of these rats, the number of phospho-H3(+), GFAP(+) and 3-weeks-old BrdU(+) cells was specifically decreased. The reduced striatal expression of CB1 receptor in repeated URB597-treated rats was only associated with a reduced apoptosis. In contrast, the striatum of acute URB597-treated rats showed an increased number of subventricular proliferative, astroglial and apoptotic cells, which was accompanied with increased Faah expression. Main results indicated that FAAH inhibitor URB597 decreased neural proliferation, glia and apoptosis in a brain region-dependent manner, which were coupled to local changes in Faah and/or Cnr1 expression and a negative energy context.},

   abstract = {The cannabinoid (CB) system is widespread in the central nervous system and is crucial for controlling a range of neurophysiological processes such as pain, appetite, and cognition. The endogenous CB molecules, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, interact with the G-protein coupled CB receptors, CB(1) and CB(2). These receptors are also targets for the phytocannabinoids isolated from the cannabis plant and synthetic CB receptor ligands. The CB system is emerging as a key regulator of neuronal cell fate and is capable of conferring neuroprotection by the direct engagement of prosurvival pathways and the control of neurogenesis. Many neurological conditions feature a neurodegenerative component that is associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, and certain CB molecules have been demonstrated to inhibit these events to halt the progression of neurodegeneration. Such properties are attractive in the development of new strategies to treat neurodegenerative conditions of diverse etiology, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral ischemia. This article will discuss the experimental and clinical evidence supporting a potential role for CB-based therapies in the treatment of certain neurological diseases that feature a neurodegenerative component.},

   abstract = {In order to investigate the sequence and pattern of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease, the distribution and density of cannabinoid CB1, dopamine D1 and D2, adenosine A(2a) and GABA(A) receptor changes were studied in the basal ganglia in early (grade 0), intermediate (grades 1, 2) and advanced (grade 3) neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. The results showed a sequential pattern of receptor changes in the basal ganglia with increasing neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. First, the very early stages of the disease (grade 0) were characterized by a major loss of cannabinoid CB1, dopamine D2 and adenosine A(2a) receptor binding in the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus externus and an increase in GABA(A) receptor binding in the globus pallidus externus. Second, intermediate neuropathological grades (grades 1, 2) showed a further marked decrease of CB1 receptor binding in the caudate nucleus and putamen; this was associated with a loss of D1 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen and a loss of both CB1 and D1 receptors in the substantia nigra. Finally, advanced grades of Huntington's disease showed an almost total loss of CB1 receptors and the further depletion of D1 receptors in the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus internus, and an increase in GABA(A) receptor binding in the globus pallidus internus.These findings suggest that there is a sequential but overlapping pattern of neurodegeneration of GABAergic striatal efferent projection neurons in increasing neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. First, GABA/enkephalin striatopallidal neurons projecting to the globus pallidus externus are affected in the very early grades of the disease. Second, GABA/substance P striatonigral neurons projecting to the substantia nigra are involved at intermediate neuropathological grades. Finally, GABA/substance P striatopallidal neurons projecting to the globus pallidus internus are affected in the late grades of the disease. In addition, the finding that cannabinoid receptors are dramatically reduced in all regions of the basal ganglia in advance of other receptor changes in Huntington's disease suggests a possible role for cannabinoids in the progression of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.

These products contained non-HIV specific active compounds that were ultimately found to disrupt the vaginal epithelium, cause increased immune activation in the female genital tract, disturb vaginal flora, and/or cause other irritation that precluded their use as vaginal microbicides. Due to the failure of these first-generation candidates, there was a shift in focus to developing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and microbicides containing small-molecule antiretrovirals. Even with the limited success of the antiretroviral-based microbicides in clinical evaluations and no commercially available products, there has been significant progress in microbicide research. The lessons learned from previous trials have given rise to more rigorous preclinical evaluation that aims to be better at predicting microbicide efficacy and safety and to novel formulation and delivery technologies. These advances have resulted in renewed interest in developing non-antiretroviral-based microbicides, such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (for example, VRC01) and anti-viral proteins (for example, Griffithsin), as options for persons not wanting to use antiretroviral drugs, and for their potential to prevent multiple sexually transmitted infections.},

   abstract = {The postsynaptic targets of cholinergic boutons in the rat neostriatum were assessed by examination in the electron microscope of boutons that were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase, the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine. These boutons formed symmetrical synaptic specializations with neostriatal neurons. Of 209 immunoreactive synaptic boutons observed in random searches of the neostriatum, 45% made contact with dendritic shafts, 34% with dendritic spines, and 20% with neuronal perikarya. Many of the postsynaptic structures had ultrastructural characteristics of the most common type of striatal neuron, the medium-size densely spiny neuron. This was confirmed by the examination in the electron microscope of Golgi-impregnated medium-size spiny neurons from sections that had also been immunostained for choline acetyltransferase. Immunoreactive boutons formed symmetrical synaptic specializations with all parts of the neurons examined, i.e., perikarya, proximal and distal dendritic shafts, and dendritic spines. Two of the Golgi-impregnated medium-size spiny neurons that received input from the cholinergic boutons were also retrogradely labelled with horseradish peroxidase that had been injected into the substantia nigra, they were thus further characterized as striatonigral neurons. Similarly, seven retrogradely labelled perikarya of striatonigral neurons were found to receive input from the cholinergic boutons. It is concluded that cholinergic boutons in the neostriatum form synaptic specializations and that one of their major targets is the medium-size densely spiny neuron that projects to the substantia nigra. The topography of the cholinergic afferents of these cells is distinctly different from that of other boutons derived from local neurons and from boutons that form asymmetrical synaptic specializations, but it is similar to that of the dopaminergic boutons originating from neurons in the substantia nigra.},

In fact, the administration of plant-derived, synthetic or endogenous cannabinoids produces several effects on motor function. These effects are mediated primarily through the CB(1) receptors that are densely located in the dopamine-enriched basal ganglia networks, suggesting that the motor effects of endocannabinoids are due, at least in part, to modulation of dopaminergic transmission. On the other hand, there are profound changes in CB(1) receptor cannabinoid signaling in the basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion (as happens in Parkinson's disease) and following l-DOPA replacement therapy. Therefore, it has been suggested that endocannabinoid system modulation may constitute an important component in new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of motor disturbances. In this article we will review studies supporting the endocannabinoid modulation of dopaminergic motor circuits.},

We have investigated whether a different sensitivity to ionotropic glutamatergic agonists might account for this differential vulnerability. Intracellular recordings were obtained from morphologically identified striatal spiny neurons and LA cholinergic interneurons by using a rat brain slice preparation. The two striatal neuronal subtypes had strikingly different intrinsic membrane properties. Both subtypes responded to cortical stimulation with excitatory postsynaptic potentials: these potentials, however, had a different time course and pharmacology in the two classes of cells. Interestingly, membrane depolarizations and inward currents produced by exogenous glutamate receptor agonists (AMPA, kainate, and NMDA) were remarkably larger in spiny neurons than in LA interneurons. Moreover, concentrations of agonists producing reversible membrane changes in LA interneurons caused irreversible depolarizations in spiny cells. Our data suggest that the different physiological responses induced by the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors may account for the cell type-specific vulnerability of striatal neurons in ischemia and HD.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the progressive onset of cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms. In parallel, the neuropathology of HD is characterized by progressive loss of projection neurons in cortex and striatum; striatal cholinergic interneurons are relatively spared. Nonetheless, there is evidence that striatal acetylcholine (ACh) function is altered in HD. The present study is the first to examine striatal ACh function in awake, behaving animals, using the R6/2 mouse model of HD, which is transgenic for exon 1 of the mutant huntingtin gene. Physiological levels of extracellular striatal ACh were monitored in R6/2 mice and wild type controls using in vivo microdialysis. Results indicate that spontaneous ACh release is reduced in R6/2 mice relative to controls. Intrastriatal application of the GABA A antagonist bicuculline methiodide (10.0??M) significantly elevated ACh levels in both R6/2 mice and wild type controls, while overall ACh levels were reduced in the R6/2 mice compared to the wild type group. In contrast, systemic administration of the D 1 dopamine receptor partial agonist, SKF-38393 (10.0mg/kg, IP), elevated ACh levels in control animals, but not R6/2 mice. Taken together, the present results suggest that GABA-mediated inhibition of striatal ACh release is intact in R6/2 mice, further demonstrating that cholinergic interneurons are capable of increased ACh release, whereas D 1 receptor-dependent activation of excitatory inputs to striatal cholinergic interneurons is dysfunctional in R6/2 mice. Reduced levels of extracellular striatal ACh in HD may reflect abnormalities in the excitatory innervation of cholinergic interneurons, which may have implications ACh-dependent processes that are altered in HD, including corticostriatal plasticity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids are promising medicines to slow down disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), two of the most important disorders affecting the basal ganglia. Two pharmacological profiles have been proposed for cannabinoids being effective in these disorders. On the one hand, cannabinoids like Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol protect nigral or striatal neurons in experimental models of both disorders, in which oxidative injury is a prominent cytotoxic mechanism. This effect could be exerted, at least in part, through mechanisms independent of CB(1) and CB(2) receptors and involving the control of endogenous antioxidant defences. On the other hand, the activation of CB(2) receptors leads to a slower progression of neurodegeneration in both disorders. This effect would be exerted by limiting the toxicity of microglial cells for neurons and, in particular, by reducing the generation of proinflammatory factors. It is important to mention that CB(2) receptors have been identified in the healthy brain, mainly in glial elements and, to a lesser extent, in certain subpopulations of neurons, and that they are dramatically up-regulated in response to damaging stimuli, which supports the idea that the cannabinoid system behaves as an endogenous neuroprotective system. This CB(2) receptor up-regulation has been found in many neurodegenerative disorders including HD and PD, which supports the beneficial effects found for CB(2) receptor agonists in both disorders. In conclusion, the evidence reported so far supports that those cannabinoids having antioxidant properties and/or capability to activate CB(2) receptors may represent promising therapeutic agents in HD and PD, thus deserving a prompt clinical evaluation.},

   abstract = {We have previously found that thalamostriatal axodendritic terminals are reduced as early as 1 month of age in heterozygous Q140 HD mice (Deng et al. [] Neurobiol Dis 60:89-107). Because cholinergic interneurons are a major target of thalamic axodendritic terminals, we examined the VGLUT2-immunolabeled thalamic input to striatal cholinergic interneurons in heterozygous Q140 males at 1 and 4 months of age, using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunolabeling to identify cholinergic interneurons. Although blinded neuron counts showed that ChAT(+) perikarya were in normal abundance in Q140 mice, size measurements indicated that they were significantly smaller. Sholl analysis further revealed the dendrites of Q140 ChAT(+) interneurons were significantly fewer and shorter. Consistent with the light microscopic data, ultrastructural analysis showed that the number of ChAT(+) dendritic profiles per unit area of striatum was significantly decreased in Q140 striata, as was the abundance of VGLUT2(+) axodendritic terminals making synaptic contact with ChAT(+) dendrites per unit area of striatum. The density of thalamic terminals along individual cholinergic dendrites was, however, largely unaltered, indicating that the reduction in the areal striatal density of axodendritic thalamic terminals on cholinergic neurons was due to their dendritic territory loss. These results show that the abundance of thalamic input to individual striatal cholinergic interneurons is reduced early in the life span of Q140 mice, raising the possibility that this may occur in human HD as well. Because cholinergic interneurons differentially affect striatal direct vs. indirect pathway spiny projection neurons, their reduced thalamic excitatory drive may contribute to early abnormalities in movement in HD.

However, the cell- and synapse-specificity of the functional relationship between astrocytes and neurons in certain brain circuits remains unknown. In the dorsal striatum, which mainly comprises two intermingled subtypes (striatonigral and striatopallidal) of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and synapses belonging to two neural circuits (the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia), subpopulations of astrocytes selectively responded to specific MSN subtype activity. These subpopulations of astrocytes released glutamate that selectively activated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in homotypic, but not heterotypic, MSNs. Likewise, astrocyte subpopulations selectively regulated homotypic synapses through metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. Therefore, bidirectional astrocyte-neuron signaling selectively occurs between specific subpopulations of astrocytes, neurons, and synapses.},

   abstract = {The striatum regulates motor output, and it is thought that changes in the synaptic efficacy of inputs to the striatum contribute to motor learning and habit formation. Previously, several laboratories have observed that brief high frequency stimulation (HFS) of cortical afferents innervating the dorsolateral striatum induces a long-term decrease in synaptic efficacy called long-term depression (LTD). We recently showed that HFS-induced striatal LTD requires retrograde signalling involving postsynaptic release of endocannabinoids and activation of presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In the present study we have employed whole-cell recording in brain slices to examine a new form of LTD at corticostriatal synapses that can be induced by a 10 Hz, 5 min train. The decrease in synaptic efficacy is associated with a decrease in presynaptic release probability, as demonstrated by a decrease in frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and an increase in the paired pulse ratio (PPR). This form of LTD is blocked by antagonists for CB1 and D2 dopamine receptors and impaired by blockers of L-type calcium channels. However, 10 Hz-induced LTD does not depend on postsynaptic depolarization, unlike HFS-induced LTD. Furthermore, this new form of LTD is not prevented by treatments known to block HFS-induced LTD, including antagonism of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), chelation of postsynaptic calcium, or intracellular application of an anandamide membrane transport inhibitor (VDM11). From these findings it is not clear that the endocannabinoid responsible for this form of LTD acts in a retrograde fashion, and the cellular source of endocannabinoid necessary for 10 Hz-induced LTD is as yet unknown. Our results demonstrate that a prolonged moderate frequency train induces cannabinoid-dependent LTD, further supporting the idea that endocannabinoids play a prominent role in the regulation of long-lasting changes in striatal output.},

   abstract = {The mammalian striatum receives its main excitatory input from the two types of cortical pyramidal neurons of layer 5 of the cerebral cortex - those with only intratelencephalic connections (IT-type) and those sending their main axon to the brainstem via the pyramidal tract (PT-type). These two neurons types are present in layer 5 of all cortical regions, and thus they appear to project together to all parts of striatum. These two neuron types, however, differ genetically, morphologically, and functionally, with IT-type neurons conveying sensory and motor planning information to striatum and PT-type neurons conveying an efference copy of motor commands (for motor cortex at least). Anatomical and physiological data for rats, and more recent data for primates, indicate that these two cortical neuron types also differ in their targeting of the two main types of striatal projection neurons, with the IT-type input preferentially innervating direct pathway neurons and the PT-type input preferentially innervating indirect pathway striatal neurons. These findings have implications for understanding how the direct and indirect pathways carry out their respective roles in movement facilitation and movement suppression, and they have implications for understanding the role of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in adaptive motor control by the basal ganglia.},

While late stage pathology includes cell death, the appearance of motor symptoms parallels more subtle changes in neuronal function and synaptic integration. Because of the difficulty in modeling the disease and the complexity of the corticostriatal network, understanding the mechanisms driving pathology has been slow to develop. In recent years, advances in animal models and network analysis tools have begun to shed light on the circuit-specific deficits. These studies have revealed a progressive impairment of corticostriatal synaptic signaling in subpopulations of striatal neurons, turning classical excitotoxicity models of HD upside down. Disrupted brain derived neurotrophic factor signaling appears to be a key factor in this decline.},

Overactivation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which include mGluR1 as well as mGluR5 and are coupled via phospholipase C to the inositol phosphate pathway, is found to be involved in mutant htt-mediated neurotoxicity. However, activation of mGluR5 also leads to neuronal protection. Here, we report that mutant htt can activate both mGluR5-mediated ERK and JNK signaling pathways. While increased JNK signaling causes cell death, activation of ERK signaling pathway is protective against cell death. Expression of mutant htt in cultured cells causes greater activation of JNK than ERK. These findings suggest that selective inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway may offer an effective therapeutic approach for reducing htt-mediated excitotoxicity.},

Adeno-associated virus delivery to striatum and overlying cortex of the mutant Htt gene, but not the wild type, produced neuropathology and motor deficits. Treatment with cc-siRNA-Htt in mice with mutant Htt prolonged survival of striatal neurons, reduced neuropil aggregates, diminished inclusion size, and lowered the frequency of clasping and footslips on balance beam. cc-siRNA-Htt was designed to target human wild-type and mutant Htt and decreased levels of both in the striatum. Our findings indicate that a single administration into the adult striatum of an siRNA targeting Htt can silence mutant Htt, attenuate neuronal pathology, and delay the abnormal behavioral phenotype observed in a rapid-onset, viral transgenic mouse model of HD.},

In a previous HD study, we identified several carbonylated proteins, including pyridoxal kinase and antiquitin, both of which are involved in the metabolism of pyridoxal 5´-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6. In the present study, pyridoxal kinase levels were quantified and showed to be decreased both in HD patients and a R6/1 mouse model, compared to control samples. A metabolomic analysis was used to analyze metabolites in brain samples of HD patients and R6/1 mice, compared to control samples using mass spectrometry. This technique allowed detection of increased concentrations of pyridoxal, the substrate of pyridoxal kinase. In addition, PLP, the product of the reaction, was decreased in striatum from R6/1 mice. Furthermore, glutamate and cystathionine, both substrates of PLP-dependent enzymes were increased in HD. This reinforces the hypothesis that PLP synthesis is impaired, and could explain some alterations observed in the disease. Together, these results identify PLP as a potential therapeutic agent.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid CB1 receptors are densely expressed on striatal projection neurons expressing dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. However, the specific neuronal distribution of CB1 receptors within the striatum is not known. Previous research has established that the endocannabinoid system controls facilitation of behavior by dopamine D2 receptors, but it is not clear if endocannabinoids also modulate D1 receptor-mediated motor behavior. In the present study, we show that cannabinoid CB1 receptor mRNA is present in striatonigral neurons expressing substance P and dopamine D1 receptors, as well as in striatopallidal neurons expressing enkephalin and dopamine D2 receptors. We explored the functional relevance of the interaction between dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and cannabinoid CB1 receptors with behavioral pharmacology experiments. Potentiation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling by the uptake blocker AM404 blocked dopamine D1 receptor-mediated grooming and D2 receptor-mediated oral stereotypies. In addition, contralateral turning induced by unilateral intrastriatal infusion of D1 receptor agonists is counteracted by AM404 and potentiated by the cannabinoid antagonist SR141716A. These results indicate that the endocannabinoid system negatively modulates D1 receptor-mediated behaviors in addition to its previously described effect on dopamine D2 receptor-mediated behaviors. The effect of AM404 on grooming behavior was absent in dopamine D1 receptor knockout mice, demonstrating its dependence on D1 receptors. This study indicates that the endocannabinoid system is a relevant negative modulator of both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-mediated behaviors, a finding that may contribute to our understanding of basal ganglia motor disorders.},

   abstract = {Huntington's Disease is an adult-onset dominant heritable disorder characterized by progressive psychiatric disruption, cognitive deficits, and loss of motor coordination. It is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the N-terminal domain of the Huntingtin protein. The mutation confers a toxic gain-of-function phenotype, resulting in neurodegeneration that is most severe in the striatum. Increasing experimental evidence from genetic model systems such as mice, zebrafish, and Drosophila suggest that polyglutamine expansion within the Huntingtin protein also disrupts its normal biological function. Huntingtin is widely expressed during development and has a complex and dynamic distribution within cells. It is predicted to be a protein of pleiotropic function, interacting with a large number of effector proteins to mediate a host of physiological processes. In this review, we highlight the wildtype function of Huntingtin, focusing on its postdevelopmental roles in axonal trafficking, regulation of gene transcription, and cell survival. We then discuss how potential loss-of-function phenotypes resulting in polyglutamine expansion within Huntingtin may have direct relevance to the underlying pathophysiology of Huntington's Disease.},

To test this possibility, we have created conditional HD mice expressing a neuropathogenic form of mutant huntingtin (mhtt-exon1) in discrete neuronal populations. We show that mhtt aggregation is a cell-autonomous process. However, progressive motor deficits and cortical neuropathology are only observed when mhtt expression is in multiple neuronal types, including cortical interneurons, but not when mhtt expression is restricted to cortical pyramidal neurons. We further demonstrate an early deficit in cortical inhibition, suggesting that pathological interactions between interneurons and pyramidal neurons may contribute to the cortical manifestation of HD. Our study provides genetic evidence that pathological cell-cell interactions elicited by neuropathogenic forms of mhtt can critically contribute to cortical pathogenesis in a HD mouse model.

Here, we used an automated microscope that tracks thousands of neurons individually over their entire lifetime to quantify interconnected relationships between early variables, such as htt levels, polyQ length, and IB formation, and neuronal death in a primary striatal model of HD. The resulting model revealed that mutant htt increases the risk of death by tonically interfering with homeostatic coping mechanisms rather than producing accumulated damage to the neuron, htt toxicity is saturable, the rate-limiting steps for inclusion body formation and death can be traced to different conformational changes in monomeric htt, and IB formation reduces the impact of the starting levels of htt of a neuron on its risk of death. Finally, the model that emerges from our quantitative measurements places critical limits on the potential mechanisms by which mutant htt might induce neurodegeneration, which should help direct future research.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary body movement, cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbance. A polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminal region of the huntingtin (htt) protein is the genetic cause of HD. Htt protein interacts with a wide variety of proteins, and htt mutation causes cell signaling alterations in various neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and cannabinoid systems, as well as trophic factor systems. This review will overview recent findings concerning htt-promoted alterations in cell signaling that involve different neurotransmitters and trophic factor systems, especially involving mGluR1/5, as glutamate plays a crucial role in neuronal cell death. The neuronal cell death that takes place in the striatum and cortex of HD patients is the most important factor underlying HD progression. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) have a very controversial role in neuronal cell death and it is not clear whether mGluR1/5 activation either protects or exacerbates neuronal death. Thus, understanding how mutant htt protein affects glutamatergic receptor signaling will be essential to further establish a role for glutamate receptors in HD and develop therapeutic strategies to treat HD.},

   abstract = {There is considerable evidence that alterations in striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSSNs) giving rise to the direct (D1 receptor-expressing) and indirect (D2 receptor-expressing) pathways differentially contribute to the phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD). To determine how each subpopulation of MSSN is functionally affected, we examined spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and dopamine (DA) modulation in two HD mouse models, the YAC128 and the BACHD (a bacterial-artificial chromosome). These mice also expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the promoter for either DA D1 or D2 receptors to identify neurons. In early symptomatic YAC128 and BACHD mice, glutamate transmission was increased in both D1 and D2 MSSNs, but in different ways. D1 cells displayed increased sEPSC frequencies and decreased paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) while D2 cells displayed larger evoked glutamate currents but no change in sEPSC frequencies or PPRs. D1 receptor modulation of sEPSCs was absent in D1-YAC128 cells at the early symptomatic stage but was restored by treating the slices with tetrabenazine. In contrast, in fully symptomatic YAC128 mice, glutamate transmission was decreased specifically in D1 cells, and D1 receptor modulation was normal in D1-YAC128 cells. Behaviorally, early symptomatic mice showed increased stereotypies that were decreased by tetrabenazine treatment. Together, these studies support differential imbalances in glutamate and DA transmission in direct and indirect pathway MSSNs. Stereotypic behavior at an early stage could be explained by increased glutamate activity and DA tone in direct pathway neurons, whereas hypokinesia at later stages could result from reduced input onto these neurons.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by an abnormal polyglutamine expansion within the protein huntingtin and is characterized by microscopic inclusion bodies of aggregated huntingtin and by the death of selected types of neuron. Whether inclusion bodies are pathogenic, incidental or a beneficial coping response is controversial. To resolve this issue we have developed an automated microscope that returns to precisely the same neuron after arbitrary intervals, even after cells have been removed from the microscope stage. Here we show, by survival analysis, that neurons die in a time-independent fashion but one that is dependent on mutant huntingtin dose and polyglutamine expansion; many neurons die without forming an inclusion body. Rather, the amount of diffuse intracellular huntingtin predicts whether and when inclusion body formation or death will occur. Surprisingly, inclusion body formation predicts improved survival and leads to decreased levels of mutant huntingtin elsewhere in a neuron. Thus, inclusion body formation can function as a coping response to toxic mutant huntingtin.},

These alleles encode a fusion protein designed to increase effective expression levels by concentrating hM3Dq to the cell body and dendrites. To illustrate their broad utility, we targeted three different genetically defined cell populations: noradrenergic neurons of the compact, bilateral locus coeruleus and two dispersed populations, Camk2a+ neurons and GFAP+ glia. In all three populations, we observed reproducible expression and confirmed that activation of hM3Dq is sufficient to dose-dependently evoke phenotypic changes, without extreme phenotypes associated with hM3Dq overexpression.

   abstract = {Modulation of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) activity has been touted as a potential means of treating addiction, anxiety, depression, and neurodegeneration. Different agonists of CB1 are known to evoke varied responses in vivo. Functional selectivity is the ligand-specific activation of certain signal transduction pathways at a receptor that can signal through multiple pathways. To understand cannabinoid-specific functional selectivity, different groups have examined the effect of individual cannabinoids on various signaling pathways in heterologous expression systems. In the current study, we compared the functional selectivity of six cannabinoids, including two endocannabinoids (2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA)), two synthetic cannabinoids (WIN55,212-2 and CP55,940), and two phytocannabinoids (cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) on arrestin2-, Gα(i/o)-, Gβγ-, Gα(s)-, and Gα(q)-mediated intracellular signaling in the mouse STHdh(Q7/Q7) cell culture model of striatal medium spiny projection neurons that endogenously express CB1. In this system, 2-AG, THC, and CP55,940 were more potent mediators of arrestin2 recruitment than other cannabinoids tested. 2-AG, AEA, and WIN55,212-2, enhanced Gα(i/o) and Gβγ signaling, with 2-AG and AEA treatment leading to increased total CB1 levels. 2-AG, AEA, THC, and WIN55,212-2 also activated Gα(q)-dependent pathways. CP55,940 and CBD both signaled through Gα(s). CP55,940, but not CBD, activated downstream Gα(s) pathways via CB1 targets. THC and CP55,940 promoted CB1 internalization and decreased CB1 protein levels over an 18-h period. These data demonstrate that individual cannabinoids display functional selectivity at CB1 leading to activation of distinct signaling pathways. To effectively match cannabinoids with therapeutic goals, these compounds must be screened for their signaling bias.},

We found that cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors promote food intake in fasted mice by increasing odor detection. CB1 receptors were abundantly expressed on axon terminals of centrifugal cortical glutamatergic neurons that project to inhibitory granule cells of the main olfactory bulb (MOB). Local pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed that endocannabinoids and exogenous cannabinoids increased odor detection and food intake in fasted mice by decreasing excitatory drive from olfactory cortex areas to the MOB. Consistently, cannabinoid agonists dampened in vivo optogenetically stimulated excitatory transmission in the same circuit. Our data indicate that cortical feedback projections to the MOB crucially regulate food intake via CB1 receptor signaling, linking the feeling of hunger to stronger odor processing. Thus, CB1 receptor-dependent control of cortical feedback projections in olfactory circuits couples internal states to perception and behavior.},

   abstract = {The CB1 cannabinoid receptor, the main molecular target of endocannabinoids and cannabis active components, is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the mammalian brain. In particular, the CB1 receptor is highly expressed in the basal ganglia, mostly on terminals of medium-sized spiny neurons, where it plays a key neuromodulatory function. The CB1 receptor also confers neuroprotection in various experimental models of striatal damage. However, the assessment of the physiological relevance and therapeutic potential of the CB1 receptor in basal ganglia-related diseases is hampered, at least in part, by the lack of knowledge of the precise mechanism of CB1 receptor neuroprotective activity. Here, by using an array of pharmacological, genetic and pharmacogenetic (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) approaches, we show that (1) CB1 receptor engagement protects striatal cells from excitotoxic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway, which, in turn, (2) induces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression through the selective activation of BDNF gene promoter IV, an effect that is mediated by multiple transcription factors. To assess the possible functional impact of the CB1/BDNF axis in a neurodegenerative-disease context in vivo, we conducted experiments in the R6/2 mouse, a well-established model of Huntington's disease, in which the CB1 receptor and BDNF are known to be severely downregulated in the dorsolateral striatum. Adeno-associated viral vector-enforced re-expression of the CB1 receptor in the dorsolateral striatum of R6/2 mice allowed the re-expression of BDNF and the concerted rescue of the neuropathological deficits in these animals. Collectively, these findings unravel a molecular link between CB1 receptor activation and BDNF expression, and support the relevance of the CB1/BDNF axis in promoting striatal neuron survival.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids act as neuromodulatory and neuroprotective cues by engaging type 1 cannabinoid receptors. These receptors are highly abundant in the basal ganglia and play a pivotal role in the control of motor behaviour. An early downregulation of type 1 cannabinoid receptors has been documented in the basal ganglia of patients with Huntington's disease and animal models. However, the pathophysiological impact of this loss of receptors in Huntington's disease is as yet unknown. Here, we generated a double-mutant mouse model that expresses human mutant huntingtin exon 1 in a type 1 cannabinoid receptor-null background, and found that receptor deletion aggravates the symptoms, neuropathology and molecular pathology of the disease. Moreover, pharmacological administration of the cannabinoid Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol to mice expressing human mutant huntingtin exon 1 exerted a therapeutic effect and ameliorated those parameters. Experiments conducted in striatal cells show that the mutant huntingtin-dependent downregulation of the receptors involves the control of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor gene promoter by repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor and sensitizes cells to excitotoxic damage. We also provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that supports type 1 cannabinoid receptor control of striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and the decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels concomitant with type 1 cannabinoid receptor loss, which may contribute significantly to striatal damage in Huntington's disease. Altogether, these results support the notion that downregulation of type 1 cannabinoid receptors is a key pathogenic event in Huntington's disease, and suggest that activation of these receptors in patients with Huntington's disease may attenuate disease progression.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive decline in motor abilities, as well as in cognitive and social behaviors. Most of these behavioral deficits are recapitulated in the R6/1 transgenic mouse, which can therefore be used as an experimental model to identify the neurobiological substrates of HD pathology and to design novel therapeutic approaches. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a relevant candidate to participate in the etiopathology of HD as it is a key modulator of brain function, especially in areas primarily affected by HD dysfunction such as the striatum. Thus, some studies have demonstrated an association between HD progression and alterations in the expression of several ECS elements, thereby suggesting that improving ECS function may constitute a useful strategy to eliminate or at least delay the appearance of HD symptoms. Here this hypothesis was specifically tested by evaluating whether the administration of a well-characterized cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212), either acutely or chronically, improves the HD-like symptoms in R6/1 mice. While acute treatment did not change the behavioral phenotype of transgenic animals, chronic administration was able to prevent the appearance of motor deficits, to increase the number of striatal huntingtin inclusions and to prevent the loss of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons, without affecting the social or cognitive alterations. These findings suggest that prolonged administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists could be an appropriate strategy for selectively improving motor symptoms and stimulating neuroprotective processes in HD patients.},

   abstract = {The CB1 cannabinoid receptor, the main molecular target of endocannabinoids and cannabis active components, is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the mammalian brain. Of note, CB1 receptors are expressed at the synapses of two opposing (i.e., GABAergic/inhibitory and glutamatergic/excitatory) neuronal populations, so the activation of one and/or another receptor population may conceivably evoke different effects. Despite the widely reported neuroprotective activity of the CB1 receptor in animal models, the precise pathophysiological relevance of those two CB1 receptor pools in neurodegenerative processes is unknown. Here, we first induced excitotoxic damage in the mouse brain by (i) administering quinolinic acid to conditional mutant animals lacking CB1 receptors selectively in GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, and (ii) manipulating corticostriatal glutamatergic projections remotely with a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug pharmacogenetic approach. We next examined the alterations that occur in the R6/2 mouse, a well-established model of Huntington disease, upon (i) fully knocking out CB1 receptors, and (ii) deleting CB1 receptors selectively in corticostriatal glutamatergic or striatal GABAergic neurons. The data unequivocally identify the restricted population of CB1 receptors located on glutamatergic terminals as an indispensable player in the neuroprotective activity of (endo)cannabinoids, therefore suggesting that this precise receptor pool constitutes a promising target for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {Huntingtin is a 350-kilodalton protein of unknown function that is mutated in HuntingtonÕs disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder. The mutant protein is presumed to acquire a toxic gain of function that is detrimental to striatal neurons in the brain. However, loss of a beneÞcial activity of wild-type huntingtin may also cause the death of striatal neurons. Here we demonstrate that wild-type huntingtin up-regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain. We show that this beneÞcial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This leads to insufÞcient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then die. Restoring wild-type huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches for treating HD.},

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding for huntingtin protein. A lot has been learned about this disease since its first description in 1872 and the identification of its causative gene and mutation in 1993. We now know that the disease is characterized by several molecular and cellular abnormalities whose precise timing and relative roles in pathogenesis have yet to be understood. HD is triggered by the mutant protein, and both gain-of-function (of the mutant protein) and loss-of-function (of the normal protein) mechanisms are involved. Here we review the data that describe the emergence of the ancient huntingtin gene and of the polyglutamine trait during the last 800 million years of evolution. We focus on the known functions of wild-type huntingtin that are fundamental for the survival and functioning of the brain neurons that predominantly degenerate in HD. We summarize data indicating how the loss of these beneficial activities reduces the ability of these neurons to survive. We also review the different mechanisms by which the mutation in huntingtin causes toxicity. This may arise both from cell-autonomous processes and dysfunction of neuronal circuitries. We then focus on novel therapeutical targets and pathways and on the attractive option to counteract HD at its primary source, i.e., by blocking the production of the mutant protein. Strategies and technologies used to screen for candidate HD biomarkers and their potential application are presented. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities offered by intracerebral cell transplantation and the likely need for these multiple routes into therapies to converge at some point as, ideally, one would wish to stop the disease process and, at the same time, possibly replace the damaged neurons.},

   abstract = {Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant with neurotoxic properties. Heavy use increases the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), production of peroxynitrites, microglia stimulation, and induces hyperthermia and anorectic effects. Most METH recreational users also consume cannabis. Preclinical studies have shown that natural (Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta9-THC) and synthetic cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists exert neuroprotective effects on different models of cerebral damage. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Delta9-THC on METH-induced neurotoxicity by examining its ability to reduce astrocyte activation and nNOS overexpression in selected brain areas. Rats exposed to a METH neurotoxic regimen (4 x 10 mg/kg, 2 hours apart) were pre- or post-treated with Delta9-THC (1 or 3 mg/kg) and sacrificed 3 days after the last METH administration. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against nNOS and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). Results showed that, as compared to corresponding controls (i) METH-induced nNOS overexpression in the caudate-putamen (CPu) was significantly attenuated by pre- and post-treatment with both doses of Delta9-THC (-19% and -28% for 1 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals; -25% and -21% for 3 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals); (ii) METH-induced GFAP-immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly reduced in the CPu by post-treatment with 1 mg/kg Delta9-THC1 (-50%) and by pre-treatment with 3 mg/kg Delta9-THC (-53%); (iii) METH-induced GFAP-IR was significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by pre- and post-treatment with both doses of Delta9-THC (-34% and -47% for 1 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals; -37% and -29% for 3 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals). The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A attenuated METH-induced nNOS overexpression in the CPu, but failed to counteract the Delta9-THC-mediated reduction of METH-induced GFAP-IR both in the PFC and CPu. Our results indicate that Delta9-THC reduces METH-induced brain damage via inhibition of nNOS expression and astrocyte activation through CB1-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively.},

In few decades, CB1 receptors have been shown to regulate a large array of functions from brain cell development and survival to complex cognitive processes. Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying these functions of CB1 is complex due to the heterogeneity of the brain cell types on which the receptor is expressed. Although the large majority of CB1 receptors act on neurons, early studies pointed to a direct control of CB1 receptors over astroglial functions including brain energy supply and neuroprotection. In line with the growing concept of the tripartite synapse highlighting astrocytes as direct players in synaptic plasticity, astroglial CB1 receptor signaling recently emerged as the mediator of several forms of synaptic plasticity associated to important cognitive functions. Here, we shortly review the current knowledge on CB1 receptor-mediated astroglial functions. This functional spectrum is large and most of the mechanisms by which CB1 receptors control astrocytes, as well as their consequences in vivo, are still unknown, requiring innovative approaches to improve this new cannabinoid research field.},

   abstract = {Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, but their functions within neural circuits in health and disease remain incompletely understood. We used genetically encoded Ca(2+)and glutamate indicators to explore the rules for astrocyte engagement in the corticostriatal circuit of adult wild-type (WT) and Huntington's disease (HD) model mice at ages not accompanied by overt astrogliosis (at approximately postnatal days 70-80). WT striatal astrocytes displayed extensive spontaneous Ca(2+)signals, but did not respond to cortical stimulation, implying that astrocytes were largely disengaged from cortical input in healthy tissue. In contrast, in HD model mice, spontaneous Ca(2+)signals were significantly reduced in frequency, duration, and amplitude, but astrocytes responded robustly to cortical stimulation with evoked Ca(2+)signals. These action-potential-dependent astrocyte Ca(2+)signals were mediated by neuronal glutamate release during cortical stimulation, accompanied by prolonged extracellular glutamate levels near astrocytes and tightly gated by Glt1 glutamate transporters. Moreover, dysfunctional Ca(2+)and glutamate signaling that was observed in HD model mice was largely, but not completely, rescued by astrocyte specific restoration of Kir4.1, emphasizing the important contributions of K(+)homeostatic mechanisms that are known to be reduced in HD model mice. Overall, our data show that astrocyte engagement in the corticostriatal circuit is markedly altered in HD. Such prodromal astrocyte dysfunctions may represent novel therapeutic targets in HD and other brain disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We report how early-onset astrocyte dysfunction without detectable astrogliosis drives disease-related processes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). The cellular mechanisms involve astrocyte homeostasis and signaling mediated by Kir4.1, Glt1, and Ca(2+) The data show that the rules for astrocyte engagement in a neuronal circuit are fundamentally altered in a brain disease caused by a known molecular defect and that fixing early homeostasis dysfunction remedies additional cellular deficits. Overall, our data suggest that key aspects of altered striatal function associated with HD may be triggered, at least in part, by dysfunctional astrocytes, thereby providing details of an emerging striatal microcircuit mechanism in HD. Such prodromal changes in astrocytes may represent novel therapeutic targets. Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/363453-18$15.00/0.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids induce apoptosis on glioma cells via stimulation of ceramide synthesis de novo, whereas they do not affect viability of primary astrocytes. In the present study, we show that incubation with Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol did not induce accumulation of ceramide on astrocytes, although incubation of these cells in a serum-free medium (with or without cannabinoids) led to stimulation of ceramide synthesis de novo and sensitization to oxidative stress. Thus treatment with H2O2 induced apoptosis of 5-day-serum-deprived astrocytes and this effect was abrogated by pharmacological blockade of ceramide synthesis de novo. The sensitizing effect of ceramide accumulation may depend on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation rather than on other ceramide targets. Finally, a protective role of cannabinoids on astrocytes is shown as a long-term incubation with cannabinoids prevented H2O2-induced loss of viability in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. In summary, our results show that whereas challenge of glioma cells with cannabinoids induces accumulation of de novo -synthesized ceramide and apoptosis, long-term treatment of astrocytes with these compounds does not stimulate this pathway and also abrogates the sensitizing effects of ceramide accumulation.},

Mutant htt (mhtt) leads to selective neurodegeneration that preferentially affects striatal medium spiny neurons. Although mhtt is also expressed in astrocytes, whether and how astrocyte derived mhtt contributes to the neurodegeneration in HD remains largely unknown. In this study, a glia HD model, using an adenoviral vector to express wild-type and mutant N-terminal huntingtin fragment 1-552 aa (htt552) in rat primary cortical astrocytes, was generated. The influence of htt552 on the protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in astrocytes was evaluated. Immunofluorescence showed that htt552-100Q formed aggregates in some astrocytes. These mhtt aggregates sequestered clathrin immunoreactivities and dispersed the Golgi complex. ELISA and immunofluorescence demonstrated an increase in BDNF levels in the astrocytes expressing htt552-100Q. Western blot analysis showed that there was an increase in pro-BDNF, but a decrease in mature BDNF in the astrocytes expressing htt552-100Q. Furthermore, medium collected from astrocytes expressing htt552-100Q showed a lower level of mature BDNF and less activity in supporting neurite development of primary cortical neurons. These results suggest that aggregates formed by mutant htt552 affect processing and secretion of the BDNF in astrocytes, which might contribute to the neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in HD. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Cannabinoid CB₁ receptor (CB₁R) activation decreases synaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission and it also controls peripheral metabolism. Here we aimed at testing with ¹³C NMR isotopomer analysis whether CB₁Rs could have a local metabolic role in brain areas having high CB₁R density, such as the hippocampus. We labelled hippocampal slices with the tracers [2-¹³C]acetate, which is oxidized in glial cells, and [U-¹³C]glucose, which is metabolized both in glia and neurons, to evaluate metabolic compartmentation between glia and neurons. The synthetic CB₁R agonist WIN55212-2 (1 μM) significantly decreased the metabolism of both [2-¹³C]acetate (-11.6±2.0%) and [U-¹³C]glucose (-11.2±3.4%) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle that contributes to the glutamate pool. WIN55212-2 also significantly decreased the metabolism of [U-¹³C]glucose (-11.7±4.0%) but not that of [2-¹³C]acetate contributing to the pool of GABA. These effects of WIN55212-2 were prevented by the CB₁R antagonist AM251 (500 nM). These results thus suggest that CB₁Rs might be present also in hippocampal astrocytes besides their well-known neuronal localization. Indeed, confocal microscopy analysis revealed the presence of specific CB₁R immunoreactivity in astrocytes and pericytes throughout the hippocampus. In conclusion, CB₁Rs are able to control hippocampal intermediary metabolism in both neuronal and glial compartments, which suggests new alternative mechanisms by which CB₁Rs control cell physiology and afford neuroprotection.},

Glial cells physiology appears very different in healthy versus pathological brain and the recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands in glia has triggered a number of studies exploring the role of (endo)cannabinoid system in glia functionality and disease. (Endo)cannabinoids exert their effects in these cells directly affecting some important peculiar functions of the glia and actively promoting biochemical signals ending in a pro-survival fate for these cells. By contrast, (endo)cannabinoids induce a selective death in glia-derived tumor cells. Of special physiological and therapeutic relevance is the reported ability of glial cells during neuropathological conditions to release an increased amount of endocannabinoids and to overexpress cannabinoid receptors. This evidence has suggested that the endocannabinoids production by glial cells may constitute an endogenous defense mechanism preventing the propagation of neuroinflammation and cell damage. The present paper will review the evidence supporting the regulatory role of (endo)cannabinoids in glia function, holding in consideration their therapeutic potential as neuroprotective and/or anticancer agents.},

This metabolic function makes MGL an interesting target for the treatment of neuroinflammation, since 2-AG exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and AA is a precursor for pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Astrocytes are an important source of AA and 2-AG, and highly express MGL. In the present study, we dissected the distinct contribution of MGL in astrocytes on brain 2-AG and AA metabolism by generating a mouse model with genetic deletion of MGL specifically in astrocytes (MKO(GFAP)). MKO(GFAP) mice exhibit moderately increased 2-AG and reduced AA levels in brain. Minor accumulation of 2-AG in the brain of MKO(GFAP) mice does not cause cannabinoid receptor desensitization as previously observed in mice globally lacking MGL. Importantly, MKO(GFAP) mice exhibit reduced brain prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels upon peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. These observations indicate that MGL-mediated degradation of 2-AG in astrocytes provides AA for prostaglandin synthesis promoting LPS-induced neuroinflammation. The beneficial effect of astrocyte-specific MGL-deficiency is not fully abrogated by the inverse cannabinoid receptor 1 agonist SR141716 (Rimonabant) suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects are rather caused by reduced prostaglandin synthesis than by activation of cannabinoid receptors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that MGL in astrocytes is an important regulator of 2-AG levels, AA availability, and neuroinflammation.},

   abstract = {Glial subcellular particles (gliosomes) have been purified from rat cerebral cortex or mouse spinal cord and investigated for their ability to release glutamate. Confocal microscopy showed that gliosomes are enriched with glia-specific proteins, such as GFAP and S-100 but not neuronal proteins, such as PSD-95, MAP-2, and ??-tubulin III. Furthermore, gliosomes exhibit labeling neither for integrin-??M nor for myelin basic protein, specific for microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. The gliosomal fraction contains proteins of the exocytotic machinery coexisting with GFAP. Consistent with ultrastructural analysis, several nonclustered vesicles are present in the gliosome cytoplasm. Finally, gliosomes represent functional organelles that actively export glutamate when subjected to releasing stimuli, such as ionomycin, high KCl, veratrine, 4-aminopyridine, AMPA, or ATP by mechanisms involving extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores as well as reversal of glutamate transporters. In addition, gliosomes can release glutamate also by a mechanism involving heterologous transporter activation (heterotransporters) located on glutamate-releasing and glutamate transporter-expressing (homotransporters) gliosomes. This glutamate release involves reversal of glutamate transporters and anion channel opening, but not exocytosis. Both the exocytotic and the heterotransporter-mediated glutamate release were more abundant in gliosomes prepared from the spinal cord of transgenic mice, model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, than in controls; suggesting the involvement of astrocytic glutamate release in the excitotoxicity proposed as a cause of motor neuron degeneration. The results support the view that gliosomes may represent a viable preparation that allows to study mechanisms of astrocytic transmitter release and its regulation in healthy animals and in animal models of brain diseases. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Studies performed in astrocytes show that the cannabinoid-evoked stimulation of glucose metabolism is independent of adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and seems to rely on the cascade CB1 cannabinoid receptor ??? Sphingomyelin breakdown ??? Ceramide ??? Raf-I ??? Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ??? Glucose utilization. A role for phosphoinositide 3'-kinase in the stimulation of glucose utilization by cannabinoids is also put forward. In addition, ceramide generated upon CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation may enhance ketone body production by astrocytes independently of MAPK. Anandamide has also been shown to exert metabolic effects in hepatocytes, cells that do-not express cannabinoid receptors. The biological role of cannabinoids as modulators of metabolism is as yet unclear.},

   abstract = {To obtain insights into the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanism of Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, we developed a new experimental approach using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), which act as glutamate biosensors, plated on cultured astrocytes. We here show that oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in astrocytes trigger synchronous and repetitive [Ca(2+)](i) elevations in sensor HEK cells, and that these elevations are sensitive to NMDAR inhibition. By whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we demonstrate that the activation of NMDARs in HEK cells results in inward currents that often have extremely fast kinetics, comparable with those of glutamate-mediated NMDAR currents in postsynaptic neurons. We also show that the release of glutamate from stimulated astrocytes is drastically reduced by agents that are known to reduce neuronal exocytosis, i.e., tetanus toxin and bafilomycin A(1). We conclude that [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations represent a frequency-encoded signaling system that controls a pulsatile release of glutamate from astrocytes. The fast activation of NMDARs in the sensor cells and the dependence of glutamate release on the functional integrity of both synaptobrevin and vacuolar H(+) ATPase suggest that astrocytes are endowed with an exocytotic mechanism of glutamate release that resembles that of neurons.},

To this end, conditional mutant mice lacking CB1 receptors from either of these cell types were pretreated systemically with JZL195, a dual inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the enzyme degrading AEA, PEA and OEA, and of monoacylglycerol lipase, the main 2-AG-degrading enzyme. The analyses of frontocortical, hippocampal and striatal AEA, 2-AG, PEA and OEA concentrations revealed that their respective baseline concentrations were not influenced by the mouse genotype. On the other hand, the accumulation of frontocortical and/or hippocampal 2-AG levels in JZL195-pretreated mice was dependent on the mouse genotype. Thus, JZL195-induced 2-AG accumulation rates were diminished in the frontal cortex of mice lacking CB1 receptors in glutamatergic neurons whilst their respective values were increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice lacking these receptors in astrocytes. These genotypic differences occurred with parallel and proportionate changes in the fractional rate constants for degradation of 2-AG, thus providing a mechanism whereby the baseline levels of 2-AG remained constant between genotypes. Besides suggesting a cell-type-specific control of frontocortical and/or hippocampal 2-AG synthesis and degradation rates by CB1 receptors, this study highlights the interest of assessing endocannabinoid turnover rates when questioning the status of the endocannabinoid system.

   abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to HTT inclusion formation in the brain. The mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) is ubiquitously expressed and therefore nuclear inclusions could be present in all brain cells. The effects of nuclear inclusion formation have been mainly studied in neurons, while the effect on glia has been comparatively disregarded. Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes are glial cells that are essential for normal brain function and are implicated in several neurological diseases. Here we examined the number of nuclear mHTT inclusions in both neurons and various types of glia in the two brain areas that are the most affected in HD, frontal cortex, and striatum. We compared nuclear mHTT inclusion body formation in three HD mouse models that express either full-length HTT or an N-terminal exon1 fragment of mHTT, and we observed nuclear inclusions in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. When studying the frequency of cells with nuclear inclusions in mice, we found that half of the population of neurons contained nuclear inclusions at the disease end stage, whereas the proportion of GFAP-positive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes having a nuclear inclusion was much lower, while microglia hardly showed any nuclear inclusions. Nuclear inclusions were also present in neurons and all studied glial cell types in human patient material. This is the first report to compare nuclear mHTT inclusions in glia and neurons in different HD mouse models and HD patient brains. GLIA 2016.},

To define the contribution of glia to HD, we established human HD glial chimeras by neonatally engrafting immunodeficient mice with mutant huntingtin (mHTT)-expressing human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs), derived from either human embryonic stem cells or mHTT-transduced fetal hGPCs. Here we show that mHTT glia can impart disease phenotype to normal mice, since mice engrafted intrastriatally with mHTT hGPCs exhibit worse motor performance than controls, and striatal neurons in mHTT glial chimeras are hyperexcitable. Conversely, normal glia can ameliorate disease phenotype in transgenic HD mice, as striatal transplantation of normal glia rescues aspects of electrophysiological and behavioural phenotype, restores interstitial potassium homeostasis, slows disease progression and extends survival in R6/2 HD mice. These observations suggest a causal role for glia in HD, and further suggest a cell-based strategy for disease amelioration in this disorder.},

Here we use a simple genetic model of Alexander disease, a progressive and severe human degenerative nervous system disease caused by a primary astroglial abnormality, to perform an in vivo screen of 1987 compounds, including many FDA-approved drugs and natural products. We identify four compounds capable of dose-dependent inhibition of nervous system toxicity. Focusing on one of these hits, glycopyrrolate, we confirm the role for muscarinic cholinergic signaling in pathogenesis using additional pharmacologic reagents and genetic approaches. We further demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic signaling works through downstream Gαq to control oxidative stress and death of neurons and glia. Importantly, we document increased muscarinic cholinergic receptor expression in Alexander disease model mice and in postmortem brain tissue from Alexander disease patients, and that blocking muscarinic receptors in Alexander disease model mice reduces oxidative stress, emphasizing the translational significance of our findings. We have therefore identified glial muscarinic signaling as a potential therapeutic target in Alexander disease, and possibly in other gliopathic disorders as well.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite the urgent need for better treatments for neurological diseases, drug development for these devastating disorders has been challenging. The effectiveness of traditional large-scale in vitro screens may be limited by the lack of the appropriate molecular, cellular, and structural environment. Using a simple Drosophila model of Alexander disease, we performed a moderate throughput chemical screen of FDA-approved drugs and natural compounds, and found that reducing muscarinic cholinergic signaling ameliorated clinical symptoms and oxidative stress in Alexander disease model flies and mice. Our work demonstrates that small animal models are valuable screening tools for therapeutic compound identification in complex human diseases and that existing drugs can be a valuable resource for drug discovery given their known pharmacological and safety profiles.},

Here, we demonstrate that the impairment of spatial working memory (SWM) and in vivo long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, induced by an acute exposure of exogenous cannabinoids, is fully abolished in conditional mutant mice lacking type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB 1R) in brain astroglial cells but is conserved in mice lacking CB 1R in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Blockade of neuronal glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and of synaptic trafficking of glutamate ??-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR) also abolishes cannabinoid effects on SWM and LTD induction and expression.

   abstract = {The striatum, which processes cortical information for behavioral output, is a key target of Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal dominant condition characterized by cognitive decline and progressive loss of motor control. Increasing evidence implicates deficient glutamate uptake caused by a down-regulation of GLT1, the primary astroglial glutamate transporter. To test this hypothesis, we administered ceftriaxone, a ??-lactam antibiotic known to elevate GLT1 expression (200 mg/kg, i.p., for 5 days), to symptomatic R6/2 mice, a widely studied transgenic model of HD. Relative to vehicle, ceftriaxone attenuated several HD behavioral signs: paw clasping and twitching were reduced, while motor flexibility, as measured in a plus maze, and open-field climbing were increased. Assessment of GLT1 expression in striatum confirmed a ceftriaxone-induced increase relative to vehicle. To determine if the change in behavior and GLT1 expression represented a change in striatal glutamate handling, separate groups of behaving mice were evaluated with no-net-flux microdialysis. Vehicle treatment revealed a glutamate uptake deficit in R6/2 mice relative to wild-type controls that was reversed by ceftriaxone. Vehicle-treated animals, however, did not differ in GLT1 expression, suggesting that the glutamate uptake deficit in R6/2 mice reflects dysfunctional rather than missing GLT1. Our results indicate that impaired glutamate uptake is a major factor underlying HD pathophysiology and symptomology. The glutamate uptake deficit, moreover, is present in symptomatic HD mice and reversal of this deficit by up-regulating the functional expression of GLT1 with ceftriaxone attenuates the HD phenotype. ?? 2008 IBRO.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate how endocannabinoids interact with excitotoxic processes both in vitro, using primary neural cell cultures, and in vivo, in the TMEV-IDD model of multiple sclerosis. First, we observed that neuronal cells respond to excitotoxic challenges by the production of endocannabinoid molecules which in turn exerted neuroprotective effects against excitotoxicity. The inhibitor of endocannabinoid uptake, UCM707, protected specifically against AMPA-induced excitotoxicity, by activating CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, as well as the nuclear factor, PPAR??. This neuroprotective effect was reverted by blocking the glial glutamate transporter, GLT-1. Mice subjected to the model of multiple sclerosis showed a decrease in the expression of GLT-1. UCM707 reversed this loss of GLT-1 and induced a therapeutic effect. Our data indicate that the enhancement of the endocannabinoid tone leads to neuroprotection against AMPA-induced excitotoxicity and provides therapeutic effects in this model of multiple sclerosis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we use electrophysiological techniques in acute preparations of hippocampal slices to demonstrate that depolarization of a single hilar mossy cell can produce robust inhibition of local GABAergic afferents. This depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) can be observed as a transient reduction in frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) or as a transient reduction in amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). We find that DSI of eIPSCs as observed in hilar mossy cells is enhanced by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocked by chelation of postsynaptic calcium, and critically dependent on retrograde activation of presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. We further report that activation of CB1 receptors on GABAergic afferents to hilar mossy cells (by either endogenous or exogenous agonists) preferentially inhibits calcium-dependent exocytosis and that endocannabinoid-dependent retrograde signaling in this system is subject to tight spatial constraints.

   abstract = {Cannabinoids have been shown to disrupt memory processes in mammals including humans. Although the CB1 neuronal cannabinoid receptor was identified several years ago, neuronal network mechanisms mediating cannabinoid effects are still controversial in animals, and even more obscure in humans. In the present study, the localization of CB1 receptors was investigated at the cellular and subcellular levels in the human hippocampus, using control post mortem and epileptic lobectomy tissue. The latter tissue was also used for [3H]GABA release experiments, testing the predictions of the anatomical data. Detectable expression of CB1 was confined to interneurons, most of which were found to be cholecystokinin-containing basket cells. CB1-positive cell bodies showed immunostaining in their perinuclear cytoplasm, but not in their somadendritic plasmamembrane. CB1-immunoreactive axon terminals densely covered the entire hippocampus, forming symmetrical synapses characteristic of GABAergic boutons. Human temporal lobectomy samples were used in the release experiments, as they were similar to the controls regarding cellular and subcellular distribution of CB1 receptors. We found that the CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, strongly reduced [3H]GABA release, and this effect was fully prevented by the specific CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716A.This unique expression pattern and the presynaptic modulation of GABA release suggests a conserved role for CB1 receptors in controlling inhibitory networks of the hippocampus that are responsible for the generation and maintenance of fast and slow oscillatory patterns. Therefore, a likely mechanism by which cannabinoids may impair memory and associational processes is an alteration of the fine-tuning of synchronized, rhythmic population events.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoid signaling, mediated by presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors on neurons, is fundamental for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity by modulating neurotransmitter release from axon terminals. In the rodent basal forebrain, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-like immunoreactivity is only harbored by a subpopulation of cholinergic projection neurons. However, endocannabinoid control of cholinergic output from the substantia innominata, coincident target innervation of cholinergic and CB 1 cannabinoid receptor-containing afferents, and cholinergic regulation of endocannabinoid synthesis in the hippocampus suggest a significant cholinergic-endocannabinergic interplay. Given the functional importance of the cholinergic modulation of endocannabinoid signaling, here we studied CB 1 cannabinoid receptor distribution in cholinergic basal forebrain territories and their cortical projection areas in a prosimian primate, the gray mouse lemur. Perisomatic CB1 cannabinoid receptor immunoreactivity was unequivocally present in non-cholinergic neurons of the olfactory tubercule, and in cholecystokinin-containing interneurons in layers 2/3 of the neocortex. Significantly, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-like immunoreactivity was localized to cholinergic perikarya in the magnocellular basal nucleus. However, cortical cholinergic terminals lacked detectable CB1 cannabinoid receptor levels. A dichotomy of CB1 cannabinoid receptor distribution in frontal (suprasylvian) and parietotemporal (subsylvian) cortices was apparent. In the frontal cortex, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing axons concentrated in layers 2/3 and layer 6, while layer 4 and layer 5 were essentially devoid of CB1 cannabinoid receptor immunoreactivity. In contrast, CB1 cannabinoid receptors decorated axons in all layers of the parietotemporal cortex with peak densities in layer 2 and layer 4. In the hippocampus, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing terminals concentrated around pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites in the CA1-CA3 areas, and granule cell dendrites in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. CB1 cannabinoid receptors frequently localized to inhibitory GABAergic terminals while leaving glutamatergic boutons unlabeled. Aging did not affect either the density or layer-specific distribution of CB1 cannabinoid receptor-immunoreactive processes. We concluded that organizing principles of CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons and their terminal fields within the basal forebrain are evolutionarily conserved between rodents and prosimian primates. In contrast, the areal expansion and cytoarchitectonic differentiation of neocortical subfields in primates is associated with differential cortical patterning of CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing subcortical and intracortical afferents. © 2005 IBRO.

   abstract = {The immunohistochemical distribution and subcellular localization of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor was determined in the adult monkey using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the amino terminus of the rat CB1 receptor. At the level of light microscopy, our results generally parallel earlier studies investigating CB1 distribution in rodent brain with a few differences. In particular, high levels of receptor were found in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum. However significant differences were also noted. The most striking differences were high levels of CB1 receptor in the monkey substantia nigra pars compacta, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the principal cells of the hippocampus, while few receptors were found in the globus pallidus or substantia nigra pars reticulata. In contrast, in a previous study investigating the rat, using the same antibody, the opposite staining pattern was observed. At the electron microscopic level CB1 receptor was restricted to neurons. Here it was found both pre- and postsynaptically, particularly on dendritic spines and axon terminals. The CB1 receptor is widely distributed in higher brain regions in the monkey. While its distribution is similar to that in the rat, there are major differences, some of which may be significant when extrapolating the behavioral effects of cannabinoids observed in rodents to primates (e.g., humans). The ultrastructural localization of the CB1 receptor suggests that it modulates neuronal excitability by both pre- and post- synaptic mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The axon collateralization patterns and synaptic connections of intracellularly labeled and electrophysiologically identified mossy cells were studied in rat hippocampus. Light microscopic analysis of 11 biocytin- filled cells showed that mossy cell axon arbors extended through an average of 57% of the total septotemporal length of the hippocampus (summated two- dimensional length, not adjusted for tissue shrinkage). Axon collaterals were densest in distant lamellae rather than in lamellae near the soma. Most of the axon was concentrated in the inner one-third of the molecular layer, with the hilus containing an average of only 26% of total axon length and the granule cell layer containing an average of only 7%. Ultrastructural analysis was carried out on three additional intracellularly stained mossy cells, in which axon collaterals and synaptic targets were examined in serial sections of chosen axon segments. In the central and subgranular regions of the hilus, mossy cell axons established a low density of synaptic contacts onto dendritic shafts, neuronal somata, and occasional dendritic spines. Most hilar synapses were made relatively close to the mossy cell somata. At greater distances from the labeled mossy cell (1-2 mm along the septotemporal axis), the axon collaterals ramified predominantly within the inner molecular layer and made a high density of asymmetric synaptic contacts almost exclusively onto dendritic spines. Quantitative measurements indicated that more than 90% of mossy cell synaptic contacts in the ipsilateral hippocampus are onto spines of proximal dendrites of presumed granule cells. These results are consistent with a primary mossy cell role in an excitatory associational network with granule cells of the dentate gyrus.},

   abstract = {1. The hypothesis that dentate hilar 'mossy' cells are excitatory was tested by simultaneous intracellular recording in rat hippocampal slices. Mossy cells were recorded simultaneously with their potential targets, granule cells and interneurons. The γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist bicuculline was used in most experiments to block the normally strong inhibitory inputs to granule cells that could mask excitatory effects of mossy cells. Some cells were recorded with electrodes containing the marker Neurobiotin so that their identity could be confirmed morphologically. 2. A mossy cell action potential was immediately followed by a brief depolarization in a granule cell in 20 of 1,316 pairs (1.5%) that were recorded in the presence of bicuculline. The mean amplitude of depolarizations was 1.99 ± 0.24 (SE) mV when the postsynaptic membrane potential was -55 to -65 mV. Depolarizations could trigger an action potential if the granule cell was depolarized from its resting potential so that its membrane potential was -50 to -60 mV. These data suggest that mossy cells excite granule cells monosynaptically. 3. Monosynaptic excitation of an interneuron by a mossy cell was recorded in 4 of 47 (8.5%) simultaneously recorded mossy cells and interneurons, also in the presence of bicuculline. The mean interneuron depolarization was 1.64 ± 0.29 mV when the interneuron membrane potential was approximately -60 mV. When an interneuron was at its resting potential (-52 to -63 mV), action potentials were often triggered by the depolarizations. 4. Without bicuculline present, mossy cells had no apparent monosynaptic effects on granule cells, as has been previously reported. However, effects that appeared to be polysynaptic were observed in 5 of 92 pairs (5.4%). Specifically, a small, brief hyperpolarization occurred in granule cells 2.5-7.3 ms after the peak of a mossy cell action potential. Given the results indicating that mossy cells excite interneurons, and the long latency to onset of the hyperpolarization, one possible explanation for the hyperpolarization is that mossy cells excited interneurons that inhibited granule cells. 5. The results suggest that mossy cells are excitatory neurons. In addition, mossy cells appear to innervate both granule cells and interneurons that are located within several hundred micrometers of the mossy cell soma. The only detectable effect on granule cells in this area under normal conditions appears to be disynaptic and inhibitory. However, when GABA(A)-receptor mediated inhibition is blocked, monosynaptic excitation of granule cells by mossy cells can be detected.},

While both decreases and increases in synaptic strength are seen as playing a role in learning and memory, long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy has received far less attention than its counterpart long-term potentiation (LTP). Never-the-less, LTD at synapses can play an important role in increasing computational flexibility in neural networks. In addition, like learning and memory processes, the magnitude of LTD can be modulated by factors that include stress and sex hormones, neurotrophic support, learning environments, and age. Examining how these factors modulate hippocampal LTD can provide the means to better elucidate the molecular underpinnings of learning and memory processes. This is in turn will enhance our appreciation of how both increases and decreases in synaptic plasticity can play a role in different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.},

   abstract = {The dentate hilus has been extensively studied in relation to its potential role in memory and in temporal lobe epilepsy. Little is known, however, about the synapses formed between the two major cell types in this region, glutamatergic mossy cells and hilar interneurons, or the organization of local circuits involving these cells. Using triple and quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in rat hippocampal slices, we find that mossy cells evoke EPSPs with high failure rates onto hilar neurons. Mossy cells show profound synapse specificity; 87.5% of their intralamellar connections are onto hilar interneurons. Hilar interneurons also show synapse specificity and preferentially inhibit mossy cells; 81% of inhibitory hilar synapses are onto mossy cells. Hilar IPSPs have low failure rates, are blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist gabazine, and exhibit short-term depression when tested at 17 Hz. Surprisingly, more than half (57%) of the mossy cell synapses we found onto interneurons were part of reciprocal excitatory/ inhibitory local circuit motifs. Neither the high degree of target cell specificity, nor the significant enrichment of structured polysynaptic local circuit motifs, could be explained by nonrandom sampling or somatic proximity. Intralamellar hilar synapses appear to function primarily by integrating synchronous inputs and presynaptic burst discharges, allowing hilar cells to respond over a large dynamic range of input strengths. The reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron local circuit motifs we find enriched in the hilus may generate sparse neural representations involved in hippocampal memory operations.

However, the signals controlling NP proliferation remain elusive. Endocannabinoids, the endogenous counterparts of marijuana-derived cannabinoids, act as neuromodulators via presynaptic CB1 receptors and also control neural cell death and survival. Here we show that progenitor cells express a functional endocannabinoid system that actively regulates cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, NPs produce endocannabinoids and express the CB1 receptor and the endocannabinoid-inactivating enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). CB1 receptor activation promotes cell proliferation and neurosphere generation, an action that is abrogated in CB1-deficient NPs. Accordingly, proliferation of hippocampal NPs is increased in FAAH-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that endocannabinoids constitute a new group of signaling cues that regulate NP proliferation and thus open novel therapeutic avenues for manipulation of NP cell fate in the adult brain.},

By contrast, astrocytes are under neuronal control through specific neurotransmitter receptors5–7. However, whether the activation of astroglial receptors can directly regulate cellular glucose metabolism to eventually modulate behavioural responses is unclear. Here we show that activation of mouse astroglial type-1 cannabinoid receptors associated with mitochondrial membranes (mtCB1) hampers the metabolism of glucose and the production of lactate in the brain, resulting in altered neuronal functions and, in turn, impaired behavioural responses in social interaction assays. Specifically, activation of astroglial mtCB1 receptors reduces the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS4, which decreases the stability and activity of complex I. This leads to a reduction in the generation of reactive oxygen species by astrocytes and affects the glycolytic production of lactate through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 pathway, eventually resulting in neuronal redox stress and impairment of behavioural responses in social interaction assays. Genetic and pharmacological correction of each of these effects abolishes the effect of cannabinoid treatment on the observed behaviour. These findings suggest that mtCB1 receptor signalling can directly regulate astroglial glucose metabolism to fine-tune neuronal activity and behaviour in mice.},

Eicosanoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the "endocannabinoid" agonists for these receptors. CB1 receptors are abundant in basal ganglia, hippocampus and cerebellum, and their functional activity can be mapped during behaviors using cerebral metabolism as the neuroimaging tool. CB1 receptors couple to Gi/o to inhibit cAMP production, decrease Ca2+ conductance, increase K+ conductance, and increase mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Functional activation of G-proteins can be imaged by [35S]GTPγS autoradiography. Post-synaptically generated endocannabinoids form the basis of a retrograde signaling mechanism referred to as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) or excitation (DSE). Under circumstances of sufficient intracellular Ca2+ (e.g., burst activity in seizures), synthesis of endocannabinoids releases a diffusible retrograde messenger to stimulate presynaptic CB1 receptors. This results in suppression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, thereby relieving the post-synaptic inhibition. Tolerance develops as neurons adjust both receptor number and cellular signal transduction to the chronic administration of cannabinoid drugs. Future therapeutic drug design can progress based upon our current understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of CB1, CB2 and related receptors. One very important role for CB1 antagonists will be in the treatment of craving in the disease of substance abuse. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A potent, synthetic cannabinoid was radiolabeled and used to characterize and precisely localize cannabinoid receptors in slide-mounted sections of rat brain and pituitary. Assay conditions for 3H-CP55,940 binding in Tris-HCl buffer with 5% BSA were optimized, association and dissociation rate constants determined, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) calculated (21 nM by liquid scintillation counting, 5.2 nM by quantitative autoradiography). The results of competition studies, using several synthetic cannabinoids, add to prior data showing enantioselectivity of binding and correlation of in vitro potencies with potencies in biological assays of cannabinoid actions. Inhibition of binding by guanine nucleotides was selective and profound: Nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP and GDP inhibited binding by >90%, and GMP and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog showed no inhibition. Autoradiography showed great heterogeneity of binding in patterns of labeling that closely conform to cytoarchitectural and functional domains. Very dense 3H-CP55,940 binding is localized to the basal ganglia (lateral caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata), cerebellar molecular layer, innermost layers of the olfactory bulb, and portions of the hippocampal formation (CA3 and dentate gyrus molecular layer). Moderately dense binding is found throughout the remaining forebrain. Sparse binding characterizes the brain stem and spinal cord. Densitometry confirmed the quantitative heterogeneity of cannabinoid receptors (10 nM 3H-CP55,940 binding ranged in density from 6.3 pmol/mg protein in the substantia nigra pars reticulata to 0.15 pmol/mg protein in the anterior lobe of the pituitary). The results suggest that the presently characterized cannabinoid receptor mediates physiological and behavioral effects of natural and synthetic cannabinoids, because it is strongly coupled to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and is discretely localized to cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar structures involved with cognition and movement.},

   abstract = {The endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide is a powerful vasodilator of isolated vascular preparations, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Here we show that the vasodilator response to anandamide in isolated arteries is capsaicin-sensitive and accompanied by release of calcitonin- gene-related peptide (CGRP). The selective CGRP-receptor antagonist 8-37 CGRP (ref. 5), but not the cannabinoid CB1 receptor blocker SR141716A (ref. 7), inhibited the vasodilator effect of anandamide. Other endogenous. (2- arachidonylglycerol, palmitylethanolamide) and synthetic (HU 210, WIN 55,212- 2, CP 55,940) CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists could not mimic the action of anandamide. The selective 'vanilloid receptor' antagonist capsazepine inhibited anandamide-induced vasodilation and release of CGRP. In patch-clamp experiments on cells expressing the cloned vanilloid receptor (VR1), anandamide induced a capsazepine-sensitive current in whole cells and isolated membrane patches. Our results indicate that anandamide induces vasodilation by activating vanilloid receptors on perivascular sensory nerves and causing release of CGRP. The vanilloid receptor may thus be another molecular target for endogenous anandamide, besides cannabinoid receptors, in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids, the active components of marijuana and their endogenous counterparts, act on the brain and many other organs through the widely expressed CB1 cannabinoid receptor. In contrast, the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is abundant in the immune system and shows a restricted expression pattern in brain cells. CB2-selective agonists are, therefore, very attractive therapeutic agents as they do not cause CB1-mediated psychoactive effects. CB2 receptor expression in brain has been partially examined in differentiated cells, while its presence and function in neural progenitor cells remain unknown. Here we show that the CB2 receptor is expressed, both in vitro and in vivo, in neural progenitors from late embryonic stages to adult brain. Selective pharmacological activation of the CB2 receptor in vitro promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation and neurosphere generation, an action that is impaired in CB2-deficient cells. Accordingly, in vivo experiments evidence that hippocampal progenitor proliferation is increased by administration of the CB2-selective agonist HU-308. Moreover, impaired progenitor proliferation was observed in CB2-deficient mice both in normal conditions and on kainate-induced excitotoxicity. These findings provide a novel physiological role for the CB2 cannabinoid receptor and open a novel therapeutic avenue for manipulating neural progenitor cell fate.},

However, renewed interest has been fueled by major discoveries revealing that cannabis-derived compounds act through a signaling pathway in the human body. Here we review recent advances showing that endocannabinoid signaling is a key regulator of synaptic communication throughout the central nervous system. Its underlying molecular architecture is highly conserved in synapses from the spinal cord to the neocortex, and as a negative feed-back signal, it provides protection against excess presynaptic activity. The endocannabinoid signaling machinery operates on demand in a synapse-specific manner; therefore, its modulation offers new therapeutic opportunities for the selective control of deleterious neuronal activity in several neurological disorders. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control crucial physiological processes and their dysfunction contributes to various human diseases, including cancer. The orphan GPCR GPR55 was identified and cloned more than a decade ago, but very little is known about its physio-pathological relevance. It has been recently shown that GPR55 controls the behavior of human cancer cell lines in culture and xenografts. However, the assessment of the actual role of this receptor in malignant transformation in vivo is hampered by the lack of studies on its functional impact in clinically-relevant models of cancer. Here we demonstrate that GPR55 drives mouse skin tumor development. Thus, GPR55-deficient mice were more resistant to DMBA/TPA-induced papilloma and carcinoma formation than their wild-type littermates. GPR55 exerted this pro-tumor effect primarily by conferring a proliferative advantage on cancer cells. In addition, GPR55 enhanced skin cancer cell anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness and tumorigenicity in vivo, suggesting that it promotes not only tumor development but also tumor aggressiveness. Finally, we observed that GPR55 is upregulated in human skin tumors and other human squamous cell carcinomas compared with the corresponding healthy tissues. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal importance of GPR55 in skin tumor development, and suggest that this receptor may be used as a new biomarker and therapeutic target in squamous cell carcinomas. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: We sought to understand why (−)-cannabidiol (CBD) and (−)-cannabidiol-dimethylheptyl (CBD-DMH) exhibit distinct pharmacology, despite near identical structures. Experimental Approach: HEK293A cells expressing either human type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors or CB2 receptors were treated with CBD or CBD-DMH with or without the CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist CP55,940, CB1 receptor allosteric modulator Org27569 or CB2 receptor inverse agonist SR144528. Ligand binding, cAMP levels and βarrestin1 recruitment were measured. CBD and CBD-DMH binding was simulated with models of human CB1 or CB2 receptors, based on the recently published crystal structures of agonist-bound (5XRA) or antagonist-bound (5TGZ) human CB1 receptors. Key Results: At CB1 receptors, CBD was a negative allosteric modulator (NAM), and CBD-DMH was a mixed agonist/positive allosteric modulator. CBD and Org27569 shared multiple interacting residues in the antagonist-bound model of CB1 receptors (5TGZ) but shared a binding site with CP55,940 in the agonist-bound model of CB1 receptors (5XRA). The binding site for CBD-DMH in the CB1 receptor models overlapped with CP55,940 and Org27569. At CB2 receptors, CBD was a partial agonist, and CBD-DMH was a positive allosteric modulator of cAMP modulation but a NAM of βarrestin1 recruitment. CBD, CP55,940 and SR144528 shared a binding site in the CB2 receptor models that was separate from CBD-DMH. Conclusion and Implications: The pharmacological activity of CBD and CBD-DMH in HEK293A cells and their modelled binding sites at CB1 and CB2 receptors may explain their in vivo effects and illuminates the difficulties associated with the development of allosteric modulators for CB1 and CB2 receptors.

In equilibrium binding assays, the Org compounds significantly increased the binding of the CB1 receptor agonist [3H]CP 55,940 [(1R,3R,4R)-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1- dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-4-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexan-1-ol], indicative of a positively cooperative allosteric effect. The same compounds caused a significant, but incomplete, decrease in the specific binding of the CB 1 receptor inverse agonist [3H]SR 141716A [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) -4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride], indicative of a limited negative binding cooperativity. Analysis of the data according to an allosteric ternary complex model revealed that the estimated affinity of each Org compound was not significantly different when the radioligand was [3H]CP 55,940 or [3H]SR 141716A. However, the estimated cooperatively factor for the interaction between modulator and radioligand was greater than 1 when determined against [3H]CP 55,940 and less than 1 when determined against [3H]SR 141716A. [3H]CP 55,940 dissociation kinetic studies also validated the allosteric nature of the Org compounds, because they all significantly decreased radioligand dissociation. These data suggest that the Org compounds bind allosterically to the CB1 receptor and elicit a conformational change that increases agonist affinity for the orthosteric binding site. In contrast to the binding assays, however, the Org compounds behaved as insurmountable antagonists of receptor function; in the reporter gene assay, the guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate binding assay and the mouse vas deferens assay they elicited a significant reduction in the Emax value for CB1 receptor agonists. The data presented clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor contains an allosteric binding site that can be recognized by synthetic small molecule ligands.

In particular, endogenous allosteric modulators might represent important targets of interventions aimed at maximizing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects of drugs. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory lipid lipoxin A4 is an endogenous allosteric enhancer of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Lipoxin A4 was detected in brain tissues, did not compete for the orthosteric binding site of the CB1 receptor (vs. 3H-SR141716A), and did not alter endocannabinoid metabolism (as opposed to URB597 and MAFP), but it enhanced affinity of anandamide at the CB1 receptor, thereby potentiating the effects of this endocannabinoid both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, lipoxin A 4 displayed a CB1 receptor-dependent protective effect against β-amyloid (1-40)-induced spatial memory impairment in mice. The discovery of lipoxins as a class of endogenous allosteric modulators of CB 1 receptors may foster the therapeutic exploitation of the endocannabinoid system, in particular for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

From binding experiments with mutated CB1 and with chimeric CB1/CB2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of CB1 implicated in the recognition of SR 141716A. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. The e2 domain thus plays some role in CP 55,940 binding but none in SR 141716A recognition, binding of the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining transmembrane helices.},

   abstract = {A major goal in current neuroscience is to understand the causal links connecting protein functions, neural activity, and behavior. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is expressed in different neuronal subpopulations, and is engaged in fine-tuning excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Studies using conditional knock-out mice revealed necessary roles of CB1 receptor expressed in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons in synaptic plasticity and behavior, but whether this expression is also sufficient for brain functions is still to be determined. We applied a genetic strategy to reconstitute full wild-type CB1 receptor functions exclusively in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons and investigated endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic processes and behavior. Using this approach, we partly restored the phenotype of global CB1 receptor deletion in anxiety-like behaviors and fully restored hippocampus-dependent neuroprotection from chemically induced epileptiform seizures. These features coincided with a rescued hippocampal depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a CB1 receptor-dependent form of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic neurons. By comparison, the rescue of the CB1 receptor on dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons prolonged the time course of DSE in the amygdala, and impaired fear extinction in auditory fear conditioning. These data reveal that CB1 receptor in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons plays a sufficient role to control neuronal functions that are in large part hippocampus-dependent, while it is insufficient for proper amygdala functions, suggesting an unexpectedly complex circuit regulation by endocannabinoid signaling in the amygdala. Our data pave the way to a better understanding of neuronal networks in the context of behavior, by fine-tuned interference with synaptic transmission processes. © 2013 the authors.},

The present study demonstrated that the three human cannabinoid hCB1 coding region variants are expressed in the human and monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain. Western blot analyses of homogenates from different regions of the monkey brain demonstrated that proteins with the expected molecular weights of the cannabinoid CB1, CB1a and CB1b receptors were co-expressed throughout the brain. Given the co-localization of these receptors, we hypothesized that physical interactions between the three splice variants may affect cannabinoid pharmacology. The human cannabinoid hCB1, hCB1a, and hCB1b receptors formed homodimers and heterodimers, as determined by BRET in transiently transfected HEK 293A cells. We found that the co-expression of the human cannabinoid hCB1 and each of the splice variants increased cell surface expression of the human cannabinoid hCB1 receptor and increased Gi/o-dependent ERK phosphorylation in response to cannabinoid agonists.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabinoids such as Δ 9- tetrahydrocannabinol, the major psychoactive component of marijuana and hashish, primarily act via cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptors to produce characteristic behavioural effects in humans. Due to the tractability of rodent models for electrophysiological and behavioural studies, most of the studies of cannabinoid receptor action have used rodent cannabinoid receptors. While CB 1 receptors are relatively well-conserved among mammals, human CB 1 (hCB 1) differs from rCB 1 and mCB 1 receptors at 13 residues, which may result in differential signalling. In addition, two hCB 1 splice variants (hCB 1a and hCB 1b) have been reported, diverging in their amino-termini relative to hCB 1 receptors. In this study, we have examined hCB 1 signalling in neurones. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: hCB 1, hCB 1a hCB 1b or rCB 1 receptors were expressed in autaptic cultured hippocampal neurones from CB 1-/- mice. Such cells express a complete endogenous cannabinoid signalling system. Electrophysiological techniques were used to assess CB 1receptor- mediated signalling. KEY RESULTS: Expressed in autaptic hippocampal neurones cultured from CB 1-/- mice, hCB 1, hCB 1a and hCB 1b signal differentially from one another and from rodent CB 1 receptors. Specifically, hCB 1 receptors inhibit synaptic transmission less effectively than rCB 1 receptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that cannabinoid receptor signalling in humans is quantitatively very different from that in rodents. As the problems of marijuana and hashish abuse occur in humans, our results highlight the importance of studying hCB 1 receptors. They also suggest further study of the distribution and function of hCB 1 receptor splice variants, given their differential signalling and potential impact on human health.

To assess the molecular mechanisms responsible for modulation of CB1 receptor function by S-palmitoylation, in this study biochemical and morphological approaches were paralleled with computational analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that this acyl chain stabilizes helix 8 as well as the interaction of CB1 receptor with membrane cholesterol. In keeping with these in silico data, experimental results showed that the non-palmitoylated CB1 receptor was unable to interact efficaciously with caveolin 1, independently of its activation state. Moreover, in contrast with the wild-type receptor, the lack of S-palmitoylation in the helix 8 made the mutant CB1 receptor completely irresponsive to agonist-induced effects in terms of both lipid raft partitioning and receptor internalization. Overall, our results support the notion that palmitoylation of cysteine 415 modulates the conformational state of helix 8 and influences the interactions of CB1 receptor with cholesterol and caveolin 1, suggesting that the palmitoyl chain may serve as a functional interface for CB1 receptor localization and function.},

   abstract = {Recurrent excitatory neural networks are unstable. In the hippocampus, excitatory mossy cells (MCs) receive strong excitatory inputs from dentate granule cells (GCs) and project back onto the proximal dendrites of GCs. By targeting the ipsi- and contralateral dentate gyrus (DG) along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, MCs form an extensive recurrent excitatory circuit (GC-MC-GC) whose dysregulation can promote epilepsy. We recently reported that a physiologically relevant pattern of MC activity induces a robust form of presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) of MC-GC transmission which enhances GC output. Left unchecked, this LTP may interfere with DG-dependent learning, like pattern separation—which relies on sparse GC firing—and may even facilitate epileptic activity. Intriguingly, MC axons display uniquely high expression levels of type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs), but their role at MC-GC synapses is poorly understood. Using rodent hippocampal slices, we report that constitutively active CB1Rs, presumably via βγ subunits, selectively inhibited MC inputs onto GCs but not MC inputs onto inhibitory interneurons or CB1R-sensitive inhibitory inputs onto GCs. Tonic CB1R activity also inhibited LTP and GC output. Furthermore, brief endocannabinoid release from GCs dampened MC-GC LTP in two mechanistically distinct ways: during induction via βγ signaling and before induction via α i/o signaling in a form of presynaptic metaplasticity. Lastly, a single in vivo exposure to exogenous cannabinoids was sufficient to induce this presynaptic metaplasticity. By dampening excitatory transmission and plasticity, tonic and phasic CB1R activity at MC axon terminals may preserve the sparse nature of the DG and protect against runaway excitation.},

In experiment 1, excitotoxic lesions centred in the ACd or PL cortex did not affect acquisition of a nonmatching-to-place task in the T-maze with a retention interval of 10 s. However, the same reinforced alternation task was impaired by larger prefrontal lesions that combined ACd and PL cortices. In experiment 2, new animals were trained on a matching-to-place task in the T-maze that uses a rule counter to the animals' innate bias to alternate spontaneously. Now, discrete lesions of both the ACd and PL cortices impaired acquisition, but in different ways. Both animals with PL and with ACd lesions perseverated by nonmatching for more sessions than the controls, but only the PL animals also showed a more general increase in perseveration reflected in a further, extended period of applying an inefficient response rule (e.g. always turn right) and a deficit at reversing from matching to nonmatching. Acquisition of the matching-to-place task was also impaired by combined lesions of ACd and PL cortices. Overall, whilst spatial working memory processes appear to remain intact in those animals with discrete prefrontal lesions, the present findings provide strong evidence for the differential involvement of the prelimbic-infralimbic and anterior cingulate regions in providing behavioural flexibility.},

However, mouse CB1 (mCB1) receptor differs from human CB1 (hCB1) receptor in 13 amino acid residues. Two splice variants, hCB1a and hCB1b, diverging in their amino-termini, have been reported to be unique for hCB1 and, via different signaling properties, contribute to CB1 receptor physiology and pathophysiology. We hypothesized that splice variants also exist for the mCB1 receptor and have different signaling properties. On murine hippocampal cDNA, we identified two novel mCB1 receptor splice variants generated by splicing of introns with 117 bp and 186 bp in the N-terminal domain, corresponding to deletions of 39 or 62 amino acids, respectively. The mRNAs for the splice variants mCB1a and mCB1b are expressed at low levels in different brain regions. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from stably transfected HEK293 cells indicates a strongly reduced glycosylation because of the absence of two glycosylation sites in mCB1b. On-cell western analysis in these stable lines revealed increased internalization of mCB1a and mCB1b upon stimulation with the agonist WIN55,212-2 as compared to mCB1. Results also point toward an increased affinity to SR141716 for mCB1a, as well as slightly enhanced inhibition of neurotransmission compared to mCB1. In mCB1b, agonist-induced MAPK phosphorylation was decreased compared to mCB1 and mCB1a. Identification of mouse CB1 receptor splice variants may help to explain differences found between human and mouse endocannabinoid systems and improve the understanding of CB1 receptor signaling and trafficking in different species.

The development and function of cortical input to the striatum are thought to be regulated by activity-dependent plasticity of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses. Here we show that the induction of a form of striatal synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD), is dependent on activation of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. LTD was facilitated by blocking cellular endocannabinoid uptake, and postsynaptic loading of anandamide (AEA) produced presynaptic depression. The endocannabinoid necessary for striatal LTD is thus likely to be released postsynaptically as a retrograde messenger.

A series of groundbreaking discoveries revealed that endocannabinoid molecules are as widespread and important as conventional neurotransmitters such as glutamate or GABA, yet they act in profoundly unconventional ways. We aim to illustrate how uncovering the molecular, anatomical, and physiological characteristics of endocannabinoid signaling has revealed new mechanistic insights into several fundamental phenomena in synaptic physiology. First, we summarize unexpected advances in the molecular complexity of biogenesis and inactivation of the two endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Then, we show how these new metabolic routes are integrated into well-known intracellular signaling pathways. These endocannabinoid-producing signalosomes operate in phasic and tonic modes, thereby differentially governing homeostatic, short-term, and long-term synaptic plasticity throughout the brain. Finally, we discuss how cell type-and synapse-specific refinement of endocannabinoid signalingmay explain the characteristic behavioral effects of cannabinoids. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

Most of our knowledge of the properties and physiological consequences of the bidirectional communication between astrocytes and neurons resides at cellular and molecular levels. In contrast, much less is known at higher level of complexity, i.e. networks of cells, and the actual impact of astrocytes in the neuronal network function remains largely unexplored.

Here, we examined the mechanisms of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) in the dorsal striatum, a brain region critical for motor control and reinforcement learning. Unlike other cell types, strong depolarization of medium spiny neurons was not sufficient to yield detectable endocannabinoid release. However, when paired with postsynaptic depolarization sufficient to activate L-type calcium channels, activation of postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), either by high-frequency tetanic stimulation or an agonist, induced eCB-LTD. Pairing bursts of afferent stimulation with brief subthreshold membrane depolarizations that mimicked down-state to up-state transitions also induced eCB-LTD, which not only required activation of mGluRs and L-type calcium channels but also was bidirectionally modulated by dopamine D2 receptors. Consistent with network models, these results demonstrate that dopamine regulates the induction of a Hebbian form of long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum. However, this gating of plasticity by dopamine is accomplished via an unexpected mechanism involving the regulation of mGluR-dependent endocannabinoid release.

Accordingly, eCBs are involved in neural functions ranging from feeding homeostasis to cognition. There is great interest in understanding how exogenous (e.g., cannabis) and endogenous cannabinoids affect behavior. Because behavioral adaptations are widely considered to rely on changes in synaptic strength, the prevalence of eCB-mediated longterm depression (eCB-LTD) at synapses throughout the brain merits close attention. The induction and expression of eCB-LTD, although remarkably similar at various synapses, are controlled by an array of regulatory influences that we are just beginning to uncover. This complexity endows eCB-LTD with important computational properties, such as coincidence detection and input specificity, critical for higher CNS functions like learning and memory. In this article, we review the major molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying eCB-LTD, as well as the potential physiological relevance of this widespread form of synaptic plasticity.

For efficient internalization, the cargo proteins need to be linked to the endocytic machinery via adaptor proteins such as the heterotetrameric endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 and a variety of mostly monomeric endocytic adaptors. In line with the importance of endocytosis for nutrient uptake, cell signaling and neurotransmission, animal models and human mutations have revealed that defects in these adaptors are associated with several diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to encephalopathies.

We tested the hypothesis that CRIP1a is capable of also altering CB1R interactions with β-arrestin proteins that interact with the CB1R at the C-terminus. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that CB1R associates in complexes with either CRIP1a or β-arrestin, but CRIP1a and β-arrestin fail to coimmunoprecipitate with each other. This suggests a competition for CRIP1a and β-arrestin binding to the CB1R, which we hypothesized could attenuate the action of β-arrestin to mediate CB1R internalization. We determined that agonist-mediated reduction of the density of cell surface endogenously expressed CB1Rs was clathrin and dynamin dependent and could be modeled as agonist-induced aggregation of transiently expressed GFP-CB1R. CRIP1a overexpression attenuated CP55940-mediated GFP-CB1R as well as endogenous β-arrestin redistribution to punctae, and conversely, CRIP1a knockdown augmented β-arrestin redistribution to punctae. Peptides mimicking the CB1R C-terminus could bind to both CRIP1a in cell extracts as well as purified recombinant CRIP1a. Affinity pull-down studies revealed that phosphorylation at threonine-468 of a CB1R distal C-terminus 14-mer peptide reduced CB1R-CRIP1a association. Coimmunoprecipitation of CB1R protein complexes demonstrated that central or distal C-terminal peptides competed for the CB1R association with CRIP1a, but that a phosphorylated central C-terminal peptide competed for association with β-arrestin 1, and phosphorylated central or distal C-terminal peptides competed for association with β-arrestin 2. Thus, CRIP1a can compete with β-arrestins for interaction with C-terminal CB1R domains that could affect agonist-driven, β-arrestin-mediated internalization of the CB1R.},

This effect of THC was also exerted by the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the synthetic cannabinoids CP-55940 and HU-210, and was prevented by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716. Pertussis toxin and wortmannin blocked the CB1 receptor-evoked activation of PKB, pointing to the sequential involvement of a G1/G0 protein and phosphoinositide 3'-kinase. The functionality of the cannabinoid-induced stimulation of PKB was proved by the increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 serine 21 observed in cannabinoid-treated cells and its prevention by SR141716 and wortmannin. Cannabinoids activated PKB in the human astrocytoma cell line U373 MG, which expresses the CB1 receptor, but not in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, which expresses the CB2 receptor.

Boosting autophagy, either pharmacologically (with temsirolimus) or by dietary intervention (with trehalose), rescued the ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment of motor coordination in mice. The combination of conditional knockout mouse models and viral vector-mediated autophagy-modulating strategies in vivo showed that cannabinoid CB1 receptors located on neurons belonging to the direct (striatonigral) pathway are required for the motor-impairing activity of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol by inhibiting local autophagy. Taken together, these findings identify inhibition of autophagy as an unprecedented mechanistic link between cannabinoids and motor performance, and suggest that activators of autophagy might be considered as potential therapeutic tools to treat specific cannabinoid-evoked behavioral alterations.},

   abstract = {Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in Cannabis sativa preparations, exerts its central effects mainly through the G-protein coupled receptor CB1, a component of the endocannabinoid system. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have reported neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids in excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration models. However, the intraneuronal signaling pathways activated in vivo by THC underlying its central effects remain poorly understood. We report that THC acute administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increases the phosphorylation of Akt in mouse hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. This phosphorylation was mediated by CB1 receptors as it was blocked by the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant. Moreover, PI3K inhibition by wortmannin abrogated THC-induced phosphorylation of Akt, but blockade of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases by SL327 did not modify this activation/phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, administration of the dopaminergic D1 (SCH 23390) and D2 (raclopride) receptor antagonists did not block the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced in the striatum by cannabinoid receptor stimulation, suggesting that this effect is independent of the dopaminergic system. In addition, THC increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Therefore, activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 signaling pathway may be related to the in vivo neuroprotective properties attributed to cannabinoids. © 2007 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoid type one receptor (CB1R) is only stably surface expressed in axons, where it downregulates neurotransmitter release. How this tightly regulated axonal surface polarity is established and maintained is unclear. To address this question, we used time-resolved imaging to determine the trafficking of CB1R from biosynthesis to mature polarised localisation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We show that the secretory pathway delivery of CB1R is axonally biased and that surface expressed CB1R is more stable in axons than in dendrites. This dual mechanism is mediated by the CB1R C-terminus and involves the Helix 9 (H9) domain. Removal of the H9 domain increases secretory pathway delivery to dendrites and decreases surface stability. Furthermore, CB1RΔH9 is more sensitive to agonist-induced internalisation and less efficient at downstream signalling than CB1RWT. Together, these results shed new light on how polarity of CB1R is mediated and indicate that the C-terminal H9 domain plays key roles in this process.},

   abstract = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a widespread neuromodulatory system that plays important roles in central nervous system development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to endogenous and environmental insults. The ECS comprises cannabinoid receptors, endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids), and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of the endocannabinoids. The most abundant cannabinoid receptors are the CB1 cannabinoid receptors; however, CB2 cannabinoid receptors, transient receptor potential channels, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors are also engaged by some cannabinoids. Exogenous cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their biological effects through their interactions with cannabinoid receptors. The best-studied endogenous cannabinoids are 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide). Despite similarities in chemical structure, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and anandamide are synthesized and degraded by distinct enzymatic pathways, which impart fundamentally different physiologic and pathophysiologic roles to these two endocannabinoids. As a result of the pervasive social use of cannabis and the involvement of endocannabinoids in a multitude of biological processes, much has been learned about the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of the ECS. This review provides an introduction to the ECS with an emphasis on its role in synaptic plasticity and how the ECS is perturbed in schizophrenia.},

   abstract = {Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is expressed in different neuronal populations in the mammalian brain. In particular, CB1 on GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons exerts different functions and display different pharmacological properties in vivo. This suggests the existence of neuron-type specific signalling pathways activated by different subpopulations of CB1. In this study, we analysed CB1 expression, binding and signalling in the hippocampus of conditional mutant mice, bearing CB1 deletion in GABAergic (GABA-CB1-KO mice) or cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB1-KO mice). Compared to their wild-type littermates, Glu-CB1-KO displayed a small decrease of CB1 mRNA amount, immunoreactivity and [Â3H]CP55,940 binding. Conversely, GABA-CB1-KO mice showed a drastic reduction of these parameters, confirming that CB1 is present at much higher density on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons than glutamatergic neurons. Surprisingly, however, saturation analysis of HU210-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding demonstrated that 'glutamatergic' CB1 is more efficiently coupled to G protein signalling than 'GABAergic' CB1. Thus, the minority of CB1 on glutamatergic neurons is paradoxically several fold more strongly coupled to G protein signalling than 'GABAergic' CB1. This selective signalling mechanism raises the possibility of designing novel cannabinoid ligands that differentially activate only a subset of physiological effects of CB1 stimulation, thereby optimizing therapeutic action. Neuron-type specific cannabinoid-mediated G protein signalling in mouse hippocampus In this article we describe cell-type specific cannabinoid G protein signalling in the mouse hippocampus. Though most of hippocampal CB1 receptors can be found in the GABAergic neurons, they host only one third of the cannabinoid-activated G proteins. Glutamatergic neurons that express only the minority of CB1 accommodate two thirds of cannabinoid-activated G proteins. © 2013 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

   abstract = {Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is the principal receptor for endocannabinoids in the brain; it mainly occurs in preterminal/terminal axons and mediates retrograde neuronal signaling mechanisms. A large body of physiological and electrophysiological evidence indicates the critical role of CB1 in the regulation of hypothalamic functions. Conversely, the distribution of CB1-containing axons in the hypothalamus is essentially unknown. Therefore, we have analyzed the distribution and the ultrastructural characteristics of the CB1-immunoreactive (IR) axons in the mouse hypothalamus by using an antiserum against the C-terminal 31 amino acids of the mouse CB1. We found that CB1-IR axons innervated densely the majority of hypothalamic nuclei, except for the suprachiasmatic and lateral mammillary nuclei, in which only scattered CB1-IR fibers occurred. CB1-IR innervation of the arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei and the external zone of the median eminence corroborated the important role of CB1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions. Ultrastructural studies to characterize the phenotype of CB1-IR fibers established that most CB1 immunoreactivity appeared in the preterminal and terminal portions of axons. The CB1-IR boutons formed axospinous, axo-dendritic, and axosomatic synapses. Analysis of labeled synapses in the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei detected approximately equal numbers of symmetric and asymmetric specializations. In conclusion, the study revealed the dense and differential CB1-IR innervation of most hypothalamic nuclei and the median eminence of the mouse brain. At the ultrastructural level, CB1-IR axons established communication with hypothalamic neurons via symmetric and asymmetric synapses indicating the occurrence of retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids in hypothalamic neuronal networks. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Because activation of D2 receptors reverses the neurochemical effects of cannabinoids, we examined whether increasing dopaminergic tone in the globus pallidus (GPe) switches cannabinoid induced depression of synaptic transmission. GABAergic synaptic currents evoked in pallidal neurons by stimulation of striatal projections (IPSCs) were depressed by perfusion with the CB1R agonist ACEA. Coactivation of D2Rs with quinpirole converted the depression into stimulation. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) to limit Gi/o protein coupling also switched the CB1R-induced depression of IPSCs. The stimulation of IPSCs was blocked by the selective PKA blocker H89. Changes in the paired pulse ratio during both inhibitory and stimulatory responses indicate that the effects are due to changes in transmitter release. Postsynaptic depolarization induces endocannabinoid release that inhibits transmitter release (DSI). When D2Rs were activated with quinpirole, depolarization increased transmission instead of depressing it. This increase was blocked by AM251. We also examined the effects of CB1R/D2R coactivation on cAMP accumulation in the GPe to further verify that the AC/PKA cascade is involved. CB1R/D2R coactivation converted the inhibition of cAMP seen when each receptor is stimulated alone into a stimulation. We also determined the effects on turning behavior of unilateral injection of ACEA into the GPe of awake animals and its modification by dopamine antagonists. Blockade of D2 family receptors with sulpiride antagonized the motor effects of ACEA. We show, for the first time, that cannabinoid-inhibition of synaptic transmission in the GPe becomes a stimulation after D2Rs or PTX treatment and that the switch is probably relevant for the control of motor behavior.},

Receptor/transducer amplification factors, interpreted as the number of G-proteins activated per occupied receptor, are the ratio of the apparent B(max) of net agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to the B(max) of receptor binding. The present study examined whether amplification factors for cannabinoid receptors differ among various rat brain regions. In autoradiographic studies with [3H]WIN 55212-2 and WIN 55212-2-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, some regions displayed different relative levels of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding than receptor binding. To quantify amplification factors, membranes from different brain regions were assayed by saturation binding analysis of net WIN 55212- 2-stimulated [35S]GTPγS, [3H]SR141716A (antagonist) and [3H]WIN 55212-2 (agonist) binding. For [3H)SR141716A binding, amplification factors varied significantly from 2.0 (frontal cortex) to 7.5 (hypothalamus). For [3H]WIN 55212-2 binding, amplification factors ranged from 2.4 (hippocampus) to 5.5 (thalamus). Comparison of receptor binding and G-protein activation at subsaturating concentrations of WIN 55212-2 indicated that amplification factors may vary with receptor occupancy in some regions like cerebellum. Ratios between high-affinity [3H]WIN 55212-2 B(max) and [3H]SR141716A B(max) also differed significantly among brain regions. These results demonstrate that G-protein coupling by cannabinoid receptors differs among brain regions, and therefore depends on the cellular environment.},

Within the striatum, CB1 receptors have been shown to be localized on the same neurons as G1-coupled dopamine D2 receptors. In this study we have examined the interactions of CB1 and D2 receptors on adenylate cyclase. In striatal neurons in primary culture, both the CB1 receptor agonist [3-(1,1-dimethytheptyl)-11-hydroxy- Δ8tetrahydrocannabinol] (HU210) and the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation when applied separately. In contrast, HU210 and quinpirole in combination augmented cAMP accumulation. This augmentation was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A or the D2 antagonist sulpride. Pertussis toxin treatment of striatal neurons prevented the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by D2 receptors but unmasked a cannabinoid receptor-mediated stimulatory effect on cAMP accumulation. The cannabinoid receptor-stimulated accumulation of cAMP was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by SR141716A, suggesting that the response was regulated through the CB1 receptor. Similar augmentation of cAMP accumulation after pertussis toxin treatment was observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with, and stably expressing, the CB1 receptor. This stimulation of cAMP was not Ca2+ -sensitive and was unaffected by a range of protein kinase inhibitors. Treatment of the pertussis toxin-treated cells with cholera toxin before CB1 receptor activation amplified the stimulatory pathway, suggesting that this response was mediated through a G(s)-type G- protein. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation was not observed after pertussis toxin treatment of CHO cells expressing the human CB2 receptor, suggesting that this novel signaling pathway is unique to the cannabinoid CB1 receptor.},

Within CB 1-CB 2 receptor heteromers expressed in a neuronal cell model, agonist co-activation of CB 1and CB 2 receptors resulted in a negative cross-talk in Akt phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, one specific characteristic of CB 1-CB 2 receptor heteromers consists of both the ability of CB 1 receptor antagonists to block the effect of CB 2receptor agonists and, conversely, the ability of CB 2 receptor antagonists to block the effect of CB 1 receptor agonists, showing a bidirectional cross-antagonism phenomenon.

Here, we used calcium photometry to monitor the effect of CB 1 activation on intracellular calcium concentration. Perfusion with 5 μM CB1 aminoalkylindole agonist, WIN55,212-2 (WIN), increased intracellular calcium by several hundred nanomolar in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing CB1 and in cultured hippocampal neurons. The increase was blocked by coincubation with the CB1 antagonist, SR141716A, and was absent in nontransfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The calcium rise was WIN-specific, being essentially absent in cells treated with other classes of cannabinoid agonists, including Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol, HU-210, CP55,940, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, methanandamide, and cannabidiol. The increase in calcium elicited by WIN was independent of Gi/o, because it was present in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Indeed, pertussis toxin pretreatment enhanced the potency and efficacy of WIN to increase intracellular calcium. The calcium increases appeared to be mediated by Gq G proteins and phospholipase C, because they were markedly attenuated in cells expressing dominant-negative Gq or treated with the phospholipase C inhibitors U73122 and ET-18-OCH3 and were accompanied by an increase in inositol phosphates. The calcium increase was blocked by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin, the inositol trisphosphate receptor inhibitor xestospongin D, and the ryanodine receptor inhibitors dantrolene and 1,1′-diheptyl-4,4′- bipyridinium dibromide, but not by removal of extracellular calcium, showing that WIN releases calcium from intracellular stores. In summary, these results suggest that WIN stabilizes CB1 receptors in a conformation that enables Gq signaling, thus shifting the G protein specificity of the receptor. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Signalling networks that regulate the progression of cannabinoid CB 1 receptor-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in neurons are poorly understood. We investigated the cellular mechanisms involved in CB 1receptor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in a neuronal cell model. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Murine N18TG2 neuronal cells were used to analyse the effect of specific protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on CB 1receptor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation. The LI-COR In Cell Western assay and immunoblotting were used to measure ERK phosphorylation. KEY RESULTS: The time-course of CB 1 receptor-stimulated ERK activation occurs in three phases that are regulated by distinct cellular mechanisms in N18TG2 cells. Phase I (0-5 min) maximal ERK phosphorylation is mediated by CB 1 receptor-stimulated ligand-independent transactivation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Phase I requires G i/o βγ subunit-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and Src kinase activation and is modulated by inhibition of cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) levels. Src kinase activation is regulated by the protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B and Shp1. The Phase II (5-10 min) rapid decline in ERK phosphorylation involves PKA inhibition and serine/threonine phosphatase PP1/PP2A activation. The Phase III (10 min) plateau in ERK phosphorylation is mediated by CB 1 receptor-stimulated, ligand-independent, transactivation of multiple RTKs. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The complex expression of CB 1 receptor-stimulated ERK activation provides cellular selectivity, modulation of sensitivity to agonists, and coincidence detection with RTK signalling. RTK and PKA pathways may provide routes to novel CB 1-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of addictive disorders or neurodegenerative diseases.

   abstract = {Dopamine and endogenous cannabinoids display complex interactions in the basal ganglia. One possible level of interaction is between CB1 cannabinoid and D2 dopamine receptors. Here, we demonstrate that a regulated association of CB1 and D2 receptors profoundly alters CB1 signaling. This provides the first evidence that CB1/D2 receptor complexes exist, are dynamic, and are agonist-regulated with highest complex levels detected when both receptors are stimulated with subsaturating concentrations of agonist. The consequence of this interaction is a differential preference for signaling through a "nonpreferred" G protein. In this case, D2 receptor activation, simultaneously with CB1 receptor stimulation, results in the receptor complex coupling to Gαs protein in preference to the expected Gαi/o proteins. The result of this interaction is an increase in the second messenger cAMP, reversing an initial synergistic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity seen at subthreshold concentrations of cannabinoid agonist. Additionally, a pertussis toxin insensitive component in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinases by the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 [(1R,3R,4R)-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-4-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexan-1-ol] is revealed in cells stably expressing both CB1 and D2 receptors. Thus, concurrent receptor stimulation promotes a heterooligomeric receptor complex and an apparent shift of CB1 signaling from a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition to a partly pertussis toxin-insensitive stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation.

Facilitatory and inhibitory functional interactions between striatal A(2A)R and CB"1R have been reported, and evidence supports that this cross-talk may rely, at least in part, on the formation of A(2A)R-CB"1R heteromeric complexes. However, the specific location and properties of these heteromers have remained largely unknown. Here, by using techniques that allowed a precise visualization of the heteromers in situ in combination with sophisticated genetically modified animal models, together with biochemical and pharmacological approaches, we provide a high-resolution expression map and a detailed functional characterization of A(2A)R-CB"1R heteromers in the dorsal striatum. Specifically, our data unveil that the A(2A)R-CB"1R heteromer (i) is essentially absent from corticostriatal projections and striatonigral neurons, and, instead, is largely present in striatopallidal neurons, (ii) displays a striking G protein-coupled signaling profile, where co-stimulation of both receptors leads to strongly reduced downstream signaling, and (iii) undergoes an unprecedented dysfunction in Huntington's disease, an archetypal disease that affects striatal neurons. Altogether, our findings may open a new conceptual framework to understand the role of coordinated adenosine-endocannabinoid signaling in the indirect striatal pathway, which may be relevant in motor function and neurodegenerative diseases.},

   abstract = {1 Several studies have described functional interactions between opioid and cannabinoid receptors; the underlying mechanism(s) have not been well explored. One possible mechanism is direct receptor-receptor interactions, as has been demonstrated for a number of G-protein-coupled receptors. 2 In order to investigate interactions between opioid and cannabinoid receptors, we epitope tagged μ, δ and κ opioid receptors with Renilla luciferase and CB1 cannabinoid or CCR5 chemokine receptors with yellow fluorescent protein and examined the extent of substrate hydrolysis induced bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. 3 We find that coexpression of opioid receptors with cannabinoid receptors, but not with chemokine receptors, leads to a significant increase in the level of BRET signal, suggesting that the opioid-cannabinoid interactions are receptor specific. 4 In order to examine the implications of these interactions to signaling, we used GTPγS binding and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation assays and examined the effect of receptor activation on signaling. 5 We find that the μ receptor-mediated signaling is attenuated by the CB1 receptor agonist; this effect is reciprocal and is seen in heterologous cells and endogenous tissue expressing both receptors. 6 In order to explore the physiological consequences of this interaction, we examined the effect of receptor activation on the extent of Src and STAT3 phosphorylation and neuritogenesis in Neuro-2A cells. 7 We find that the simultaneous activation of μ opioid and CB1 cannabinoid receptors leads to a significant attenuation of the response seen upon activation of individual receptors, implicating a role for receptor-receptor interactions in modulating neuritogenesis. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

In this paper we review studies of CRIP1a function and structure based upon in vitro experiments and computational chemistry, which elucidate the specific mechanisms for the interaction of CRIP1a with CB1 receptors. N18TG2 neuronal cells overexpressing or silencing CRIP1a highlighted the ability of CRIP1 to regulate cyclic adenosine 3',5'monophosphate (cAMP) production and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. These studies indicated that CRIP1a attenuates the G protein signaling cascade through modulating which Gi/o subtypes interact with the CB1 receptor. CRIP1a also attenuates CB1 receptor internalization via β-arrestin, suggesting that CRIP1a competes for β-arrestin binding to the CB1 receptor. Predictions of CRIP1a secondary structure suggest that residues 34-110 are minimally necessary for association with key amino acids within the distal C-terminus of the CB1 receptor, as well as the mGlu8a metabotropic glutamate receptor. These interactions are disrupted through phosphorylation of serines and threonines in these regions. Through investigations of the function and structure of CRIP1a, new pharmacotherapies based upon the CRIP-CB1 receptor interaction can be designed to treat diseases such as epilepsy, motor dysfunctions and schizophrenia.},

In the two decades since the discovery of CB1, studies at the molecular level have centered on the transmembrane core. This interest has now expanded as we discover that other regions of CB1, including the CB1 carboxyl-terminus, have critical structures that are important for CB 1 activity and regulation. Following the recent description of the three dimensional structure of the full-length CB1 carboxyl-terminal tail [Biopolymers (2009) vol. 91, pp. 565-573], several residues and structural motifs including two α-helices (termed H8 and H9) have been postulated to interact with common G protein-coupled receptor accessory proteins, such as G-proteins and β-arrestins. This discourse will focus on the CB1 carboxyl-terminus; our current understanding of the structural features of this region, evidence for its interaction with proteins, and the impact of structure on the binding and regulatory function of CB1 accessory proteins. The involvement of the carboxyl-terminus in the receptor life cycle including activation, desensitization, and internalization will be highlighted. © 2011 The Authors Journal of Neurochemistry © 2011 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

   abstract = {CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) are one of the most abundantly expressed G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) in the CNS and regulate diverse neuronal functions. The identification of GPCR interacting proteins has provided additional insight into the fine-tuning and regulation of numerous GPCRs. The cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) binds to the distal carboxy terminus of CB1R, and has been shown to alter CB1R-mediated neuronal function [1]. The mechanisms by which CRIP1a regulates CB1R activity have not yet been identified; therefore the focus of this investigation is to examine the cellular effects of CRIP1a on CB1R signaling using neuronal N18TG2 cells stably transfected with CRIP1a over-expressing and CRIP1a knockdown constructs. Modulation of endogenous CRIP1a expression did not alter total levels of CB1R, ERK, or forskolin-activated adenylyl cyclase activity. When compared to WT cells, CRIP1a over-expression reduced basal phosphoERK levels, whereas depletion of CRIP1a augmented basal phosphoERK levels. Stimulation of phosphoERK by the CB1R agonists WIN55212-2, CP55940 or methanandamide was unaltered in CRIP1a over-expressing clones compared with WT. However, CRIP1a knockdown clones exhibited enhanced ERK phosphorylation efficacy in response to CP55940. In addition, CRIP1a knockdown clones displayed a leftward shift in CP55940-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. CB1R-mediated Gi3 and Go activation by CP99540 was attenuated by CRIP1a over-expression, but robustly enhanced in cells depleted of CRIP1a. Conversely, CP55940-mediated Gi1 and Gi2 activation was significant enhanced in cells over-expressing CRIP1a, but not in cells deficient of CRIP1a. These studies suggest a mechanism by which endogenous levels of CRIP1a modulate CB1R-mediated signal transduction by facilitating a Gi/o protein subtype preference for Gi1 and Gi2, accompanied by an overall suppression of G-protein-mediated signaling in neuronal cells.},

To follow the effects of agonists and antagonists on cell surface CB1Rs, we utilized the genetically homogeneous cloned neuronal cell line N18TG2, which endogenously expresses both CB1R and CRIP1a, and exhibits a well-characterized endocannabinoid signaling system. We developed stable CRIP1a-over-expressing and CRIP1a-siRNA-silenced knockdown clones to investigate gene dose effects of CRIP1a on CB1R plasma membrane expression. Results indicate that CP55940 or WIN55212-2 (10 nM, 5 min) reduced cell surface CB1R by a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent process, and this was attenuated by CRIP1a over-expression. CP55940-mediated cell surface CB1R loss was followed by a cycloheximide-sensitive recovery of surface receptors (30–120 min), suggesting the requirement for new protein synthesis. In contrast, WIN55212-2-mediated cell surface CB1Rs recovered only in CRIP1a knockdown cells. Changes in CRIP1a expression levels did not affect a transient rimonabant (10 nM)-mediated increase in cell surface CB1Rs, which is postulated to be as a result of rimonabant effects on ‘non-agonist-driven’ internalization. These studies demonstrate a novel role for CRIP1a in agonist-driven CB1R cell surface regulation postulated to occur by two mechanisms: 1) attenuating internalization that is agonist-mediated, but not that in the absence of exogenous agonists, and 2) biased agonist-dependent trafficking of de novo synthesized receptor to the cell surface.

However, the relationship between protein synthesis and presynaptic structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we investigated structural changes in cannabinoid-receptor 1 (CB1)-mediated long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD), a form of presynaptic plasticity that involves a protein-synthesis-dependent long-lasting reduction in GABA release. We found that CB1-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB1 activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB1-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB1-iLTD. Thus, CB1-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.},

Pulse experiments with [3H]AA showed that ionomycin stimulation leads to the sequential formation of [3H]phosphatidic acid ([3H]PA), [3H]DAG, and [3H]2-AG. [3H]2-AG biosynthesis in N18TG2 cells prelabeled with [3H]AA was counteracted by propranolol and N-ethylmaleimide, two inhibitors of the Mg2+/Ca2+-dependent brain PA phosphohydrolase. Pretreatment of cells with exogenous phospholipase D (PLD) led to a strong potentiation of ionomycin- induced [3H]2-AG formation. These data indicate that DAG precursors for 2- AG in intact N18TG2 cells are obtained from the hydrolysis of PA and not through the activation of PLC. The presence of 2% ethanol during ionomycin stimulation failed to elicit the synthesis of [3H]phosphatioylethanol and did not counteract the formation of [3H]PA, thus arguing against the activation of PLD by the Ca2+ ionophore. Selective inhibitors of secretory phospholipase A2 and the acyl-CoA acylase inhibitor thimerosal significantly reduced [3H]2-AG biosynthesis. The implications of these latter findings, and of the PA-dependent pathways of 2-AG formation described here, are discussed.},

Although TRPV1 receptors are mainly found in nociceptive neurons of the peripheral nervous system, these receptors have also been found in the brain, where their role is far less understood. Activation of TRPV1 reportedly regulates neurotransmitter release at several central synapses. However, we found that TRPV1 suppressed excitatory transmission in rat and mouse dentate gyrus by regulating postsynaptic function in an input-specific manner. This suppression was a result of Ca 2+-calcineurin and clathrin-dependent internalization of AMPA receptors. Moreover, synaptic activation of TRPV1 triggered a form of long-term depression (TRPV1-LTD) mediated by the endocannabinoid anandamide in a type 1 cannabinoid receptorĝ€"independent manner.

Whereas 2-AG primarily transmits a rapid, transient, point-to-point retrograde signal, the other major endocannabinoid, anandamide, may function as a relatively slow retrograde or non-retrograde signal or as an agonist of the vanilloid receptor.

TRPV1 function must lay on its anatomical distribution in the peripheral and central nervous system regions involved in the physiological roles of the channel. However, the anatomical localization of TRPV1 is well established in the periphery, but in the brain it is a matter of debate. While some studies support the presence of TRPV1 in several brain regions, recent evidences suggest a restricted distribution of the channel in the central nervous system. To investigate to what extent central TRPV1 function stands on a precise brain distribution of the channel, we examined the mouse hippocampal dentate molecular layer (ML) where TRPV1 mediates long-term synaptic plasticity. Using pre-embedding immunocytochemistry for high resolution electron microscopy, we show that TRPV1 immu-noparticles are highly concentrated in postsynaptic dendritic spines to asymmetric perforant path synapses in the outer 2/3 of the ML. However, TRPV1 is poorly expressed at the excitatory hilar mossy cell synapses in the inner 1/3 of this layer. Importantly, the TRPV1 pattern distribution disappeared in the ML of TRPV1-knockout mice. Taken together, these findings support the notion of the presence of TRPV1 in a brain region where the channel has been shown to have a functional role, such as the perforant path synapses in the hippocampal dentate ML.},

Anandamide is also generated by macrophages where its endotoxin (LPS)-induced synthesis has been implicated in the hypotension of septic shock and advanced liver cirrhosis. Anandamide can be generated from its membrane precursor, N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) through cleavage by a phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). Here we document a biosynthetic pathway for anandamide in mouse brain and RAW264.7 macrophages that involves the phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed cleavage of NAPE to generate a lipid, phosphoanandamide, which is subsequently dephosphorylated by phosphatases, including PTPN22, previously described as a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Bacterial endotoxin (LPS)-induced synthesis of anandamide in macrophages is mediated exclusively by the PLC/phosphatase pathway, which is up-regulated by LPS, whereas NAPE-PLD is down-regulated by LPS and functions as a salvage pathway of anandamide synthesis when the PLC/phosphatase pathway is compromised. Both PTPN22 and endocannabinoids have been implicated in autoimmune diseases, suggesting that the PLC/phosphatase pathway of anandamide synthesis may be a pharmacotherapeutic target. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy we examined the expression pattern of the Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1-R) in the hippocampi of CD1 mice at survival times of 2 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 2 months (acute, latent and chronic phases). Based on the behavioral signs of the acute seizures, animals were classified as "Weakly" or "Strongly" epileptic using the modified Racine scale. Mice of the weak group had mild seizures, whereas seizures in the strong group were frequent with intense motor symptoms and the majority of these animals developed sclerosis in the chronic phase. In control samples the most intense staining of CB1-R-positive fibers was found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in str. pyramidale of the cornu Ammonis. In weak animals no significant changes were seen at any survival time compared to controls. In strong animals, however, in the acute phase, a massive reduction in CB1-R-stained terminals occurred in the hippocampus. In the latent phase CB1-R immunoreactivity gradually recovered. In the chronic phase, CB1-immunostaining in sclerotic samples was stronger throughout the hippocampus. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis showed an increase in the number of CB1-R-positive terminals in the dentate gyrus. Moreover, the number of immunogold particles significantly increased in GABAergic terminals. Our results suggest a proconvulsive downregulation of CB1 receptors in the acute phase most probably due to receptor internalization, followed by compensatory upregulation and sprouting in the chronic phase of epilepsy. In conclusion, the changes in CB1 receptor expression pattern revealed in this study are associated with the severity of hippocampal injury initiated by acute seizures that ultimately leads to sclerosis in the vulnerable regions in the chronic phase. © 2011 Karlócai et al.},

We characterized two distinct signaling pathways mediating eCB production in striatal indirect-pathway MSNs and found that both pathways were modulated by dopamine D2 and adenosine A2A receptors, acting through cAMP/PKA. We identified regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) as a key link between D2/A2A signaling and eCB mobilization pathways. In contrast to wild-type mice, RGS4 -/- mice exhibited normal eCB-LTD after dopamine depletion and were significantly less impaired in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease.

Although few studies have examined this relationship, the apparent overlap observed in the neuroanatomical distribution of both systems as well as their putative functions strongly point to the existence of such cross-modulation. In agreement, biochemical and functional studies have revealed the existence of heterodimers between CB1 cannabinoid receptor and hypocretin receptor-1, which modulates the cellular localization and downstream signaling of both receptors. Moreover, the activation of hypocretin receptor-1 stimulates the synthesis of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol culminating in the retrograde inhibition of neighboring cells and suggesting that endocannabinoids could contribute to some hypocretin effects. Pharmacological data indicate that endocannabinoids and hypocretins might have common physiological functions in the regulation of appetite, reward and analgesia. In contrast, these neuromodulatory systems seem to play antagonistic roles in the regulation of sleep/wake cycle and anxiety-like responses. The present review attempts to piece together what is known about this interesting interaction and describes its potential therapeutic implications. © 2013 Flores, Maldonado and Berrendero.},

   abstract = {Several reports have focused on the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in hyperexcitability, particularly in seizure and epilepsy models. Our laboratory recently characterized a novel plasticity change of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor in hippocampi of epileptic rats following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). This long-term redistribution included selective layer-specific changes in CB1 receptor expression within distinct hippocampal subregions. However, the temporal characteristics of this redistribution during the development of epilepsy had not been examined. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the time course by which pilocarpine-induced SE produced changes in CB1 receptor expression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that within 1 week following SE, there was a pronounced loss in CB1 receptor expression throughout the hippocampus, while staining in many interneurons was preserved. By 1 month post-SE, pilocarpine-treated animals began to display epileptic seizures, and CB1 receptor expression was characteristic of the redistribution observed in long-term epileptic rats, with decreases in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale neuropil and dentate gyrus inner molecular layer, and increases in the strata oriens and radiatum of CA1-3. Observed changes in CB1 receptor expression were confirmed at multiple time points by western blot analysis. The data indicate that overall decreases in expression following SE preempt a long-lasting CB1 receptor redistribution, and that differential responses occur within the hippocampus to initial CB1 receptor losses. This suggests a role for dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system during epileptogenesis and indicates that the CB1 receptor redistribution temporally correlates with the emergence of epileptic seizures.},

   abstract = {Activation of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, a major G-protein-coupled receptor in brain, acts to regulate neuronal excitability and has been shown to mediate the anticonvulsant effects of cannabinoids in several animal models of seizure, including the rat pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy. However, the long-term effects of status epilepticus on the expression and function of the CB1 receptor have not been described. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the effect of status epilepticus on CB1 receptor expression, binding, and G-protein activation in the rat pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that status epilepticus causes a unique "redistribution" of hippocampal CB1 receptors, consisting of specific decreases in CB1 immunoreactivity in the dense pyramidal cell layer neuropil and dentate gyrus inner molecular layer, and increases in staining in the CA1-3 strata oriens and radiatum. In addition, this study demonstrates that the redistribution of CB1 receptor expression results in corresponding functional changes in CB1 receptor binding and G-protein activation using [3H] R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl](1-napthalen-yl)methanone mesylate (WIN55,212-2) and agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS autoradiography, respectively. The redistribution of CB1 receptor-mediated [35S]GTPγS binding was 1) attributed to an altered maximal effect (Emax) of WIN55,212-2 to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding, 2) reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (SR141716A), 3) confirmed by the use of other CB1 receptor agonists, and 4) not reproduced in other G-protein-coupled receptor systems examined. These results demonstrate that status epilepticus causes a unique and selective reorganization of the CB1 receptor system that persists as a permanent hippocampal neuronal plasticity change associated with the development of acquired epilepsy. © 2007 IBRO.},

   abstract = {Endocannabinoid signaling is a key regulator of synaptic neurotransmission throughout the brain. Compelling evidence shows that its perturbation leads to development of epileptic seizures, thus indicating that endocannabinoids play an intrinsic protective role in suppressing pathologic neuronal excitability. To elucidate whether long-term reorganization of endocannabinoid signaling occurs in epileptic patients, we performed comparative expression profiling along with quantitative electron microscopic analysis in control (postmortem samples from subjects with no signs of neurological disorders) and epileptic (surgically removed from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) hippocampal tissue. Quantitative PCR measurements revealed that CB1 cannabinoid receptor mRNA was downregulated to one-third of its control value in epileptic hippocampus. Likewise, the cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein-1a mRNA was decreased, whereas 1b isoform levels were unaltered. Expression of diacylglycerol lipase-α, an enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis, was also reduced by ∼60%, whereas its related β isoform levels were unchanged. Expression level of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine- hydrolyzing phospholipase D and fatty acid amide hydrolase, metabolic enzymes of anandamide, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol's degrading enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase did not change. The density of CB1 immunolabeling was also decreased in epileptic hippocampus, predominantly in the dentate gyrus, where quantitative electron microscopic analysis did not reveal changes in the ratio of CB1-positive GABAergic boutons, but uncovered robust reduction in the fraction of CB1-positive glutamatergic axon terminals. These findings show that a neuroprotective machinery involving endocannabinoids is impaired in epileptic human hippocampus and imply that downregulation of CB 1 receptors and related molecular components of the endocannabinoid system may facilitate the deleterious effects of increased network excitability.

   abstract = {The anticonvulsant effect of cannabinoids has been shown to be mediated through activation of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. This study was initiated to evaluate the effects of endogenously occurring cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) on seizure severity and threshold. The anticonvulsant effect of the endocannabinoid, arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide), was evaluated in the maximal electroshock seizure model using male CF-1 mice and was found to be a fully efficacious anticonvulsant (ED50=50 mg/kg i.p.). The metabolically stable analog of anandamide, (R)-(20-cyano-16,16-dimetyldocosa-cis-5,8,11,14-tetraenoyl)-1′ -hydroxy-2′-propylamine (O-1812), was also determined to be a potent anticonvulsant in the maximal electroshock model (ED50=1.5 mg/kg i.p.). Furthermore, pretreatment with the cannabinoid CB1 receptor specific antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H- pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A) completely abolished the anticonvulsant effect of anandamide as well as O-1812 (P≤0.01, Fisher exact test), indicating a cannabinoid CB1 receptor-mediated anticonvulsant mechanism for both endocannabinoid compounds. Additionally, the influence of cannabinoid CB1 receptor endogenous tone on maximal seizure threshold was assessed using SR141716A alone. Our data show that SR141716A (10 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced maximal seizure threshold (CC50=14.27 mA) compared to vehicle-treated animals (CC50=17.57 mA) (potency ratio=1.23, lower confidence limit=1.06, upper confidence limit=1.43), indicating the presence of an endogenous cannabinoid tone that modulates seizure activity. These data demonstrate that anandamide and its analog, O-1812, are anticonvulsant in a whole animal model and further implicate the cannabinoid CB1 receptor as a major endogenous site of seizure modulation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {Cannabinoids and their analogues have been found to inhibit N- and P/Q- type Ca2+ currents in cell lines and sympathetic neurons transfected with cannabinoid CB1 receptor. However, the effects of cannabinoids on Ca2+ currents in the CNS are largely unexplored. In this study we investigated whether these compounds inhibit Ca2+ channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. With the use of antibodies directed against the amino-terminus of the CB1 receptor, we found that in 5-day cultures pyramidally shaped neurons expressed somatic CBI receptors, whereas in 4-wk cultures the receptor was predominately located on neurites. In early cultures, the cannabimimetic WIN 55,212-2 reversibly inhibited whole cell Ba2+ current in a concentration- dependent (K1/2 = 21 nM) and pertussis-toxin-sensitive fashion. Inhibition was reduced by the CB1 antagonist SR141716. The current was unaffected by the nonpsychoactive enantiomer WIN 55,212-3. Maximal inhibition by the nonclassical cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 and by an endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, were similar to that seen with maximal concentrations of WlN 55,212-2. The Ba2+ current modulated by cannabinoids was carried by N-type (w-conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive) and P/Qtype (w-conotoxin-MVIIC-sensitive) channels. These results demonstrate cannabinoid-receptor-mediated inhibition of distinct Ca2+ channels in central neurons. Because the channels that underlie these currents are chiefly located presynaptically, and are required for evoked neurotransmitter release, our results suggest a major role for cannabinoids (endogenous and exogenous) in the modulation of synaptic transmission at CNS synapses.},

   abstract = {Treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE) affects 30% of epilepsy patients and is associated with severe morbidity and increased mortality. Cannabis-based therapies have been used to treat epilepsy for millennia, but only in the last few years have we begun to collect data from adequately powered placebo-controlled, randomized trials (RCTs) with cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis derivative. Previously, information was limited to case reports, small series, and surveys reporting on the use of CBD and diverse medical marijuana (MMJ) preparations containing: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD, and many other cannabinoids in differing combinations. These RCTs have studied the safety and explored the potential efficacy of CBD use in children with Dravet Syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The role of the placebo response is of paramount importance in studying medical cannabis products given the intense social and traditional media attention, as well as the strong beliefs held by many parents and patients that a natural product is safer and more effective than FDA-approved pharmaceutical agents. We lack valid data on the safety, efficacy, and dosing of artisanal preparations available from dispensaries in the 25 states and District of Columbia with MMJ programs and online sources of CBD and other cannabinoids. On the other hand, open-label studies with 100 mg/ml CBD (Epidiolex®, GW Pharmaceuticals) have provided additional evidence of its efficacy along with an adequate safety profile (including certain drug interactions) in children and young adults with a spectrum of TREs. Further, Phase 3 RCTs with Epidiolex support efficacy and adequate safety profiles for children with DS and LGS at doses of 10- and 20-mg/kg/day.

In membranes from N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells and the neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells, NG108-15, the psychoactive cannabinoid drugs and their nantradol analogs could inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. This response was not observed in either the soluble adenylate cyclase from rat sperm or membrane-bound adenylate cyclases from C6 glioma or S49 lymphoma cells. This cellular selectivity provides further evidence for the existence of specific receptors for the cannabimimetic compounds. Receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase requires the presence of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein complex, G(i). G(i) can be functionally inactivated as a result of an ADP-ribosylation modification catalyzed by pertussis toxin. The present study demonstrates that pertussis toxin treatment of cells abolished the cannabimimetic response in intact cells and in membranes derived therefrom. The action of pertussis toxin required NAD+ as substrate for in vitro modification of neuroblastoma membranes. Furthermore, pertussis toxin was able to catalyze the labeling of a neuroblastoma membrane protein in vitro using [32P]NAD+ under conditions similar to those by which attenuation of the cannabimimetic inhibition of adenylate cyclase could be demonstrated. This evidence demonstrates the requirement for a functional G(i) in the action of cannabimimetic drugs.},

Forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase was also inhibited by cannabimimetic agents. Inhibition by cannabinoid compounds was neither synergistic nor additive with muscarinic or alpha-adrenergic agents when each was present at maximally inhibitory concentrations. Cannabinoid inhibition was not blocked by atropine, yohimbine, or naloxone, suggesting that muscarinic, alpha2-adrenergic and certain opiate receptors may not be required for the response. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase was specific for psychoactive cannabinoids, since cannabinol and cannabidiol produced minimal or no response. Inhibition was also stereoselective, since dextronantradol did not produce the response. A biphasic log dose-response curve was observed for each of the cannabinoid drugs, such that reversal of the inhibition occurred at 3-10 μM.

The initial assessment, mainly derived from expression studies, was that cannabinoids, via Gi/o proteins, negatively modulate cyclic AMP levels, and activate inward rectifying K + channels. Recent findings have complicated this assessment on different levels: (1) cannabinoids include a wide range of compounds with varying profiles of affinity and efficacy at the known CB receptors, and these profiles do not necessarily match their biological activity; (2) CB receptors appear to be intrinsically active and possibly coupled to more than one type of G protein; (3) CB receptor signalling mechanisms are diverse and dependent on the system studied; (4) cannabinoids have other targets than CB receptors. The aim of this mini review is to discuss the current literature regarding CB receptor signalling pathways. These include regulation of adenylyl cyclase, MAP kinase, intracellular Ca2+, and ion channels.

   abstract = {The CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recognized by a variety of endogenous ligands and activating multiple signalling pathways. This multiplicity of ligands and intracellular transduction mechanisms supports a complex control of physiological functions by the endocannabinoid system, but requires a finely tuned regulation of the signalling events triggered on receptor activation. Here we review the diverse signalling pathways activated by the cannabinoid receptors and discuss the mechanisms allowing for specificity in the associated functional responses triggered by endogenous or exogenous ligands. At variance with the classical concept that all agonists at a given GPCR induce a similar repertoire of downstream events in all tissues, we also summarize the experimental evidence supporting the existence of functional selectivity and protean agonism at cannabinoid receptors. By placing emphasis on the ligand- or constitutive activity-dependent specifications of receptor-G protein coupling, these concepts explain how distinct cannabinoid ligands may activate specific downstream mediators. Finally, although both the diversity and specificity in cannabinoid signalling are now established in vitro, few data are available from in vivo studies. Therefore, we conclude this review by examining the experimental evidence supporting the physiological relevance of this complexity in the cannabinoid system. The ability to selectively manipulate physiological functions, through activation of defined signalling cascades, will in all likelihood help in the development of efficacious and safe cannabinoid-based therapeutics for a variety of indications. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The G-protein-coupled central cannabinoid receptor (CB1) has been shown to be functionally associated with several biological responses including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, modulation of ion channels and induction of the immediate-early gene Krox-24. Using stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing human CB1 we show here that cannabinoid treatment induces both phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and that these effects are inhibited by SR 141716A, a selective CB1 antagonist. The two p42 and p44 kDa MAP kinases are activated in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The rank order of potency for the activation of MAP kinases with various cannabinoid agonists is CP-55940 > Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol > WIN 55212.2, in agreement with the pharmacological profile of CB1. The activation of MAP kinases is blocked by pertussis toxin but not by treatment with hydrolysis-resistant cyclic AMP analogues. This suggests that the signal transduction pathway between CB1 and MAP kinases involves a pertussis-toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein and is independent of cyclic AMP metabolism. This coupling of CB1 subtype and mitogenic signal pathway, also observed in the human astrocytoma cell line U373 MG, may explain the mechanism of action underlying cannabinoid-induced Krox-24 induction.},

This receptor is coupled to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. However, the precise molecular mechanism for CB1-mediated ERK activation is still unknown. Here, we show that in U373 MG human astrocytoma cells, CB1 receptor activation with the cannabinoid agonist Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol dimethyl heptyl (HU-210) was coupled to ERK activation and protection from ceramide-induced apoptosis. HU-210-induced ERK activation was inhibited by tyrphostin AG1478 and PP2, widely employed inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the Src family of cytosolic tyrosine kinases, respectively. However, HU-210 stimulation resulted in neither EGFR phosphorylation, Src tyrosine phosphorylation, nor increased Src activity. In addition, dominant-negative forms of both proteins were unable to prevent cannabinoid-induced ERK activation, thus excluding the existence of CB1-mediated EGFR transactivation or Src activation. Wortmannin and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294,002), inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, blocked cannabinoid-induced ERK activation. Likewise, HU-210 stimulated the PI3K downstream targets protein kinase B (PKB), as shown by its phosphorylation in Thr 308 and Ser 473 residues, and Raf-1. Moreover, βγ subunit release mimicked ERK and PI3K/PKB activation, suggesting that activation of class IB PI3K mediates cannabinoid action. Pro-survival HU-210 action also required activation of both PI3K and ERK signaling pathways. In conclusion, CB1-induced ERK activation was mediated by PI3KIB and this effect may have important consequences in the control of cell death/survival decision.},

CB1 receptor-binding sites were detected by the high-affinity antagonist radioligand [125I]AM-251. In ECV304 cells, both the highly potent synthetic cannabinoid agonist HU-210 and the endogenous ligand anandamide induce activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and the effect of HU-210 was completely blocked, whereas the effect of anandamide was partially inhibited by SR141716A, a selective CB1 receptor antagonist. Transfection of ECV304 cells with CB1 receptor antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides caused the same pattern of inhibition as SR141716A. This provides more definitive evidence for the involvement of CB1 receptors in MAP kinase activation and suggests that anandamide may also activate MAP kinase via an additional, CB1 receptor-independent, SR141716A-resistant mechanism. The MAP kinase activation by anandamide in ECV304 cells requires genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), and anandamide also activates p38 kinase and c-Jun kinase. These findings indicate that CB1 receptors located in human vascular endothelium are functionally coupled to the MAP kinase cascade. Activation of protein kinase cascades by anandamide may be involved in the modulation of endothelial cell growth and proliferation.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids exert most of their effects through the CB1 receptor. This G-protein-coupled receptor has been shown to be functionally coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, modulation of ion channels, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the CB1 receptor cDNA, we show here that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active component of marijuana, induces the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Western blot analysis showed that both JNK-1 and JNK-2 were stimulated by THC. The effect of THC was also exerted by endogenous cannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) and synthetic cannabinoids (CP-55,940, HU-210, and methanandamide), and was prevented by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716. Pertussis toxin, wortmannin, and a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor peptide blocked, whereas mastoparan mimicked, the CB1 receptor-evoked activation of JNK, supporting the involvement of a G(i)/G(o)-protein, phosphoinositide 3'-kinase and Ras. THC-induced JNK stimulation was prevented by tyrphostin AG1296, pointing to the implication of platelet-derived growth factor receptor transactivation, and was independent of ceramide generation. Experiments performed with several types of neural cells that endogenously express the CB1 receptor suggested that long-term JNK activation may be involved in THC-induced cell death. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor was also shown to be coupled to the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Data indicate that activation of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase may be responsible for some of the cellular responses elicited by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids, including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), bind to receptors that couple to G(i/o)-proteins and inhibit adenylyl cyclase. However, like other G-protein-coupled receptors, cannabinoid receptors are also coupled to other effector systems. This review examines the characteristics of the cannabinoid-G-protein-adenylyl cyclase system, and explores the role of cyclic AMP in mediating effects of these drugs. Several conclusions emerge from this research. First, the principal actions of cannabinoids are mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors, and the intracellular signaling mechanism that initiates cellular response of cannabinoids is activation of G-proteins. Second, cannabinoid-inhibited adenylyl cyclase is only one of several different effectors coupled to these receptors, and different effectors may be used for different types of responses. Third, cannabinoid inhibition of adenylyl cyclase plays an important role in several aspects of cannabinoid function, including modulating conductance at a voltage-dependent K+ channel ('A' current) in the hippocampus, thus providing an effective rationale for behavioral effects of cannabinoids mediated in this region. Other functions of this system may include production of long-term changes in gene expression by inhibition of cyclic AMP response elements on strategic genes, and inhibition of anandamide synthesis, thus mediating some of the long-term effects of cannabinoids on neuronal function.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids activate several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily including p44 and p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We used N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) to examine the signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of ERK. ERK phosphorylation (activation) was measured by Western blot. The EC50 for stimulation of ERK phosphorylation was 10 nm, and this effect was blocked by pertussis toxin and the CB1 (cannabinoid) receptor antagonist SR141716A. The MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U0126 blocked ERK phosphorylation, as did the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 and the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 partially occluded the response but also decreased basal levels of phospho-ERK. The PI 3-kinase and Src pathways are known to promote cell survival in many systems; therefore, MTT (1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan) conversion was used to examine the effects of these inhibitors on cellular viability. LY 294002 decreased the number of viable cells after 18 h of treatment; therefore, the inhibition of ERK by this inhibitor is probably because of cytotoxicity. Forskolin blocked ERK phosphorylation with an EC50 of <3 microm, and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 enhanced ERK phosphorylation. c-Raf phosphorylation at an inhibitory PKA-regulated site (Ser259) was also reduced by WIN. This is probably due to constitutive phosphatase activity because WIN did not directly stimulate PP1 or PP2A activity when measured using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate as a fluorogenic substrate. These data implicate the inhibition of PKA as the predominant pathway for ERK activation by CB1 receptors in N1E-115 cells. PI 3-kinase and Src appear to contribute to ERK activation by maintaining activation of kinases, which prime the pathway and maintain cellular viability.},

   abstract = {Cannabinoids were found to augment phospholipase activities and modify lipid levels of mouse brain synaptosomes, myelin and mitochondria. Delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ1-THC) and several of its metabolites induced a dose-dependent (0.32-16 μM) stimulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity resulting in the increased release of free arachidonic acid from exogenous [1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (PC). The potencies of the cannabinoids in modulating PLA2 activity were approximately of the order: 7-OH-Δ1-THC > Δ1-THC > 7-oxo-Δ1-THC > Δ1-THC-7oic acid = 6α OH-Δ1-THC ≫ 6β-OH-Δ1-THC. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) by synaptosomal phospholipase C (PLC) was enhanced significantly by Δ1-THC and promoted diacylglyceride levels by greater than 100 percent compared to control values. In contrast, arachidonate was the major product resulting from phospholipase activities of a 20,000 g pellet. Synaptosomal diacylglyceride lipase activity was inhibited by Δ1-THC. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was readily incorporated into subcellular membrane phospholipids and after exposure to cannabinoids led to diminished phosphoglyceride levels and concomitant increases in released neutral lipid products. These data suggest that cannabinoids control phospholipid turnover and metabolism in mouse brain preparations by the activation of phospholipases and, through this mechanism, may exert some of their effects. © 1986 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Transient expression of the rat brain CB1 cannabinoid receptor was accomplished through microinjection of in vitro transcribed cRNA into the cytoplasm of enzymatically dissociated adult rat superior cervical ganglion neurons The cannabimimetic aminoalkylindole WIN 55,212-2 inhibited whole-cell Ca2+ currents in neurons injected 16-25 hr previously with rat brain CB1 cannabinoid receptor cRNA. Inhibition of the Ca2+ current was voltage and concentration dependent, with a maximal inhibition of 73% and an IC50 value of 47 nM. The synthetic cannabinoid analogue CP 55,940 also inhibited Ca2+ currents, with a maximal inhibition of 38% and an IC50 value of 7 nw. Ca2+ current inhibition was blocked by inclusion of guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) in the intracellular patch pipette solution or by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Pretreatment with the N-type Ca2+ channel antagonist ω-conotoxin GVIA reduced the inhibition by 100 nM WIN 55,212-2 from 44% to 6%, indicating that N-type Ca2+ channels are a target of cannabinoid action. On washout of WIN 55,212-2, the Ca2+ current amplitude "overrecovered" in 47% of the neurons tested. Anandamide, the endogenous cannabimimetic compound, had an inconsistent effect on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in the majority of neurons microinjected with cannabinoid receptor cRNA. Ca2+ channels were a specific effector target of the cannabinoid receptor, as two different K+ currents, the M current and the A current, were not modulated by the cannabimimetic WIN 55,212-2.},

In contrast, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid messenger acting on different receptors, increased both p38-MAPK and JNK phosphorylation. The effects of cannabinoids on p38-MAPK were mediated through activation of CB1-R because they were blocked in the presence of SR 141716 A and absent in CB1-R knockout mice, two conditions that did not alter the effects of LPA. The activation of p38-MAPK by cannabinoids was insensitive to inhibitors of Src.

While molecular mechanisms of MSN degeneration have been identified in animal models of striatal damage, the molecular factors that dictate a selective vulnerability of D1R-MSNs or D2R-MSNs remain unknown. Here, we combined genetic, chemogenetic, and pharmacological strategies with behavioral and neurochemical analyses, and show that the pool of cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) located on corticostriatal terminals efficiently safeguards D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, from different insults. This cell-specific response relies on the regulation of glutamatergic signaling, and is independent from the CB1R-dependent control of astroglial activity in the striatum. These findings define cortical CB1R as a pivotal synaptic player in dictating a differential vulnerability of D1R-MSNs versus D2R-MSNs, and increase our understanding of the role of coordinated cannabinergic-glutamatergic signaling in establishing corticostriatal circuits and its dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases.},

The discovery of the receptor-transporting protein family has facilitated the effective cell-surface expression of ORs in heterologous cells. The establishment of a robust heterologous expression system for mammalian ORs facilitates the high-throughput 'deorphanization' of these receptors by matching them to their cognate ligands. This protocol details the method used for evaluating the cell-surface expression and measuring the functional activation of ORs of transiently expressed mammalian ORs in HEK293T cells. The stages of OR cell-surface expression include cell culture preparation, transfer of cells, transfection, immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry, odorant stimulation and luciferase assay.

The triggering of ADs was critical for this development, as well as for the development of permanent changes in the characteristics of the AD. The wave form of the AD "spikes" became more complex. The frequency of these spikes and the duration of AD increased. The amplitude of the AD spikes increased in the structure stimulated as well as in secondary structures to which the AD was "projected". This increase in amplitude of "projected" spikes often correlated with the appearance of motor seizures. Other electrographic developments are discussed including the appearance of spontaneous "inter-ictal" spiking in the amygdala. It was found that the development of motor seizures by stimulation of the amygdala resulted in an increased ability of the contralateral amygdala, and the septal area, but not of the hippocampus, to drive motor seizures when stimulated ("transfer"). Motor seizure development in the hippocampus transferred to the contralateral hippocampus. These developments were shown, by means of control subjects, with lesions in the primary focus to involve changes outside the primary focus. The implications of these developments with respect to seizure development are discussed. © 1972.},

We have previously shown that in sympathetic neurons the neuronal isoform of the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1.1) increases the M-current, a well-known target for seizure control. The effect of SGK1.1 activation on kainate-induced seizures and neuronal excitability was studied in transgenic mice that express a permanently active form of the kinase, using electroencephalogram recordings and electrophysiological measurements in hippocampal brain slices. Our results demonstrate that SGK1.1 activation leads to reduced seizure severity and lower mortality rates following status epilepticus, in an M-current-dependent manner. EEG is characterized by reduced number, shorter duration, and early termination of kainate-induced seizures in the hippocampus and cortex. Hippocampal neurons show decreased excitability associated to increased M-current, without altering basal synaptic transmission or other neuronal properties. Altogether, our results reveal a novel and selective anticonvulsant pathway that promptly terminates seizures, suggesting that SGK1.1 activation can be a potent factor to secure the brain against permanent neuronal damage associated to epilepsy.},

Here, we report that hippocampal dopamine 2 receptor (hD2R) neurons are specifically activated by food and that both acute and chronic modulation of their activity reduces food intake in mice. Upstream projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) to the hippocampus activate hD2R cells and can also decrease food intake. Finally, activation of hD2R neurons interferes with the encoding of a spatial memory linking food to a specific location via projections from the hippocampus to the septal area. Altogether these data describe a previously unidentified LEC > hippocampus > septal higher-order circuit that regulates feeding behavior. Azevedo et al. identify a subpopulation of neurons expressing the dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) within the hippocampus that is activated by food. They show that these neurons regulate food intake and the encoding of a food-place memory.},

In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions.

G-protein sequestration occurs because the population of CB1 cannabinoid receptors exists in both an inactive G-protein-precoupled RGGDP state and a constitutively active R*GGTP state. We tested the hypothesis that the distal C-terminal tail acts to prevent G-protein activation. We found that truncation of the distal C-terminal tail of the CB1 receptor (CB1-417) enhanced both the constitutive activity and the ability of the receptor to sequester G-proteins. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the conserved aspartate (D2.50) in the second transmembrane domain of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor is crucial for constitutive activity and G-protein sequestration. We found that the mutation of aspartate to asparagine (CB1-D164N) abolished G-protein sequestration and constitutive receptor activity without disrupting agonist-stimulated activity. We conclude that the CB1-D164N mutation and the C-terminal truncation shift the population of receptors in opposite directions. The CB1-D164N mutation shifts the receptor into an inactive R state upcoupled from G-proteins, whereas the C-terminal truncation (CB1-417) shifts the receptor into the active R*GGTP state. Thus the distal C-terminal tail acts to constrain the receptor from activating G-proteins, whereas the aspartate (D2.50) in the second transmembrane domain stabilizes the receptor in both the inactive RGGDP state and the active R*GGTP state.},

The IC3 construct was designed to contain one-third of each of the transmembrane helices (TMs 5 and 6) to tether the protein to the hydrophobic portion of the micelle. Indeed, the NMR analysis illustrates prominent α-helices at the N-terminus (G1-R10) and C-terminus (Q37-T47) of the IC3 receptor domain, corresponding to the cytoplasmic termini of TM5 and TM6. The structural features of the central portion of the IC3 consist of a small α-helix, adjacent to the terminus of TM5. The remainder is mostly unstructured as indicated by the NMR-based observables (NOEs and chemical shifts). Despite the lack of secondary structure, the hydrophobic triplet of isoleucine residues in the center of the IC3 is found in molecular dynamics simulations to associate with the lipid environment, producing two smaller loops out of the IC3. Previous studies examining mastoparan and related peptides and their ability to activate G proteins have concluded an α-helix is required for efficient binding and activation. Our structural results for the IC3 of CB1 would then suggest that in the intact receptor the G protein is activated by the α-helices of the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 or TM6 and not the unstructured central region of the IC3.},

The two mutant receptors differed from wild type (WT) in their ability to regulate G-proteins in the [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay. The L7.60F receptor exhibited attenuated stimulation by agonists WIN-55,212-2 and CP-55,940 but not HU-210, whereas the L7.60I receptor exhibited impaired stimulation by all agonists tested as well as by the inverse agonist rimonabant. The mutants internalized more rapidly than WT receptors but could equally sequester G-proteins from the somatostatin receptor. Both the time course and maximal N-type Ca2+ current inhibition by WIN-55,212-2 were reduced in the mutants. Reconstitution experiments with pertussis toxin-insensitive G-proteins revealed loss of coupling to Gαi3 but not Gα0A in the L7.60I mutant, whereas the reduction in the time course for the L7.60F mutant was governed by Gαi3. Furthermore, Gαi3 but not Gα0A enhanced basal facilitation ratio, suggesting that Gαi3 is responsible for CB1 tonic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that both mutant receptors were associated with Gαi1 or Gαi2 but not with Gαi3. Molecular dynamics simulations of WT CB1 receptor and each mutant in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer suggested that the packing of H8 is different in each. The hydrogen bonding patterns along the helix backbones of each H8 also are different, as are the geometries of the elbow region of H8 (R7.56(400)-K7.58(402)).

   abstract = {Cannabis elicits its mood-enhancing and analgesic effects through the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the adenylyl cyclase-inhibiting heterotrimeric G protein Gi. Activation of CB1-Gi signaling pathways holds potential for treating a number of neurological disorders and is thus crucial to understand the mechanism of Gi activation by CB1. Here, we present the structure of the CB1-Gi signaling complex bound to the highly potent agonist MDMB-Fubinaca (FUB), a recently emerged illicit synthetic cannabinoid infused in street drugs that have been associated with numerous overdoses and fatalities. The structure illustrates how FUB stabilizes the receptor in an active state to facilitate nucleotide exchange in Gi. The results compose the structural framework to explain CB1 activation by different classes of ligands and provide insights into the G protein coupling and selectivity mechanisms adopted by the receptor.},

The nature of specific signal initiators, nuclear translocators and effectors has become increasingly clear, and supports the idea that the nucleus is able to make sense of a surprising amount of fast synaptic information through intricate biochemical mechanisms. Information transfer to the nucleus can be conveyed by physical translocation of messengers at various stages within the multiple signal transduction cascades that are set in motion by a Ca2+ rise near the surface membrane. The key role of synapse-to-nucleus signaling in circadian rhythms, long-term memory, and neuronal survival sheds light on the logical underpinning of these signaling mechanisms.},

Recently we have shown that 2-AG induces a rapid myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation/activation, early mediated by RhoA kinase (ROCK) signalling pathway and later by myosin light chain kinase. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in MLC phosphorylation and some downstream events such as actin polymerization, ATP secretion and aggregation. We demonstrated that PI3K in particular the isoforms α and β and AKT have a role in MLC phosphorylation. The stimulation of PI3K/AKT pathway activates ROCK. ROCK is directly involved in the early phase of MLC activation stimulating thr18 phosphorylation. MLC activation is strengthened through the MLC phosphatase inhibition, that is accomplished through the phosphorylation of MYPT1, catalytic subunit of MLC phosphatase, overall mediated by ROCK. In addition we have found that the PI3Kα/β isoforms and AKT are involved in the downstream mechanisms leading to actin polymerization, ATP secretion and aggregation of human platelets stimulated by 2-AG.},

Cofilin/ADF are inactivated by phosphorylation at the serine residue at position 3 by LIM-kinases (LIMKs) and testicular protein kinases (TESKs) and are reactivated by dephosphorylation by the slingshot (SSH) family of protein phosphatases and chronophin. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the signaling mechanisms regulating LIMKs and SSHs and the functional roles of cofilin phospho-regulation in cell migration, tumor invasion, mitosis, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the phospho-regulation of cofilin/ADF is a key convergence point of cell signaling networks that link extracellular stimuli to actin cytoskeletal dynamics and that spatiotemporal control of cofilin/ADF activity by LIMKs and SSHs plays a crucial role in a diverse array of cellular and physiological processes.

   abstract = {Synthesis of GAP-43 (also known as neuromodulin) in neurons is induced during axon growth, and high concentrations (estimated between 50 and 100 μM) accumulate in the growth cone. GAP-43 is tightly associated with the growth cone membrane skeleton, the structure that transduces extracellular guidance cues into alterations in morphology by spatially regulating polymerization of actin filaments, thereby causing directional changes in axon growth. GAP-43 cosediments with actin filaments, and its phosphorylation on serine 41 by PKC, too, is spatially regulated so that phosphorylated GAP- 43 is found in areas where growth cones make productive, stable contacts with other cells. In contrast, unphosphorylated GAP-43, which binds calmodulin, is always found in parts of the growth cone that are retracting. Here we have used a cell-free assay to investigate how the phosphorylation status of GAP- 43 affects its interactions with actin and show that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GAP-43 have different, independent effects on actin filament structure. Phosphorylated GAP-43 stabilizes long actin filaments (K(d) = 161 nM), and antibodies to phosphorylated GAP-43 inhibit binding of actin to phalloidin, implying a lateral interaction with filaments. In contrast, unphosphorylated GAP-43 reduces filament length distribution (K(d) = 1.2 μM) and increases the critical concentration for polymerization. Prebinding calmodulin potentiates this effect. The results show that spatially regulated post-translational modifications of GAP-43 within the growth cone, which can be regulated in response to extracellular signals, have the ability to directly influence the structure of the actin cytoskeleton.},

   abstract = {The modulation of Ca2+ channel activity by protein kinases contributes to the dynamic regulation of neuronal physiology. Using the transient expression of a family of neuronal Ca2+ channels, we have identified several factors that contribute to the PKC-dependent modulation of Ca2+ channels. First, the nature of the Ca2+ channel α1 subunit protein is critical. Both α1Bα1E channels exhibit a 30%-40% increase in peak currents after exposure to phorbol esters, whereas neither α1A nor α1C channels are significantly affected. This up-regulation can be mimicked for α1E channels by stimulation of a coexpressed metabotropic glutamate receptor (type 1α) through a PKC-dependent pathway. Second, PKC-stimulated up-regulation is dependent upon coexpression with a Ca2+ channel β subunit. Third, substitution of the cytoplasmic domain I-II linker from α1B confers PKC sensitivity to α1A channels. The results provide direct evidence for the modulation of a subset of neuronal Ca2+ channels by PKC and implicate α1 and β subunit interactions in regulating channel activity via second messenger pathways. © 1995.},

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or 1, 2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) was used to activate PKC directly, whereas indirect activation was induced with acetyl-beta-methylcholine (MCh). The interaction between PKC activators and VAs was examined by perfusing either VA before, during, or after the administration of PMA, DOG, or MCh. In addition, the effect of VAs was studied after the down-regulation of PKC. The application of VAs inhibited Ba(2+) current (I(Ba)), whereas PMA (500 nM), DOG (100 microM), or MCh (1 and 10 microM) markedly potentiated I(Ba). VAs inhibited PMA- or DOG-enhanced I(Ba) to the same extent as seen in controls. The inhibition of I(Ba) induced by VAs was not reversed by PMA or DOG. The administration of VAs in combination with PMA, DOG, or MCh (1 microM) led to the inhibition of I(Ba). MCh (10 microM) counteracted the inhibitory effect of VAs when administered together and reversed the inhibition of I(Ba) produced by VAs. These differences in the responses between PMA and MCh (10 microM) may be based on the involvement of various pools of PKC. It is suggested that VAs act directly at the membrane, because they blocked the membrane-based action of PMA, whereas the receptor-based action of MCh was only partially blocked. It is possible that some PKC isoforms may not be a direct target of VAs.},

   abstract = {Phytocannabinoids isolated from the cannabis plant have broad potential in medicine that has been well recognized for many centuries. It is presumed that these lipid soluble signaling molecules exert their effects in both the central and peripheral nervous system in large part through direct interaction with metabotropic cannabinoid receptors. These same receptors are also targeted by a variety of endogenous cannabinoids including 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and anandamide. Significant effort over the last decade has produced an enormous advance in our understanding of both the cellular and the synaptic physiology of endogenous lipid signaling systems. This increase in knowledge has left us better prepared to carefully evaluate the potential for both natural and synthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. In the case of epilepsy, long standing interest in therapeutic approaches that target endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems are, for the most part, not well justified by available clinical data from human epileptics. Nevertheless, basic science experiments have clearly indicated a key role for endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems in moment to moment regulation of neuronal excitability. Further it has become clear that these systems can both alter and be altered by epileptiform activity in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. Collectively these observations suggest clear potential for effective therapeutic modulation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems in the treatment of human epilepsy, and in fact, further highlight key obstacles that would need to be addressed to reach that goal. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Protein kinase C (PKC), a calcium-dependent phospholipid-sensitive kinase which is selectively activated by phorbol esters, is thought to play an important role in several cellular processes1,2. In mammalian brain PKC is present in high concentrations1 and has been shown to phosphorylate several substrate phospho-proteins3-6, one of which may be involved in the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP)7,8, a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy evoked by brief, high-frequency stimulation. Since the hippocampus contains one of the brain's highest levels of binding sites for phorbol esters9 and is the site where LTP has been most thoroughly characterized, we examined the effects of phorbol esters on hippocampal synaptic transmission and LTP. We found that phorbol esters profoundly potentiate excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus in a manner that appears indistinguishable from LTP. Furthermore, after maximal synaptic enhancement by phorbol esters, LTP can no longer be elicited. Although the site of synaptic enhancement during LTP is not clearly established, phorbol esters appear to potentiate synaptic transmission by acting primarily at a presynaptic locus since changes in the postsynaptic responses to the putative transmitter, glutamate, cannot account for the increased synaptic responses induced by phorbol esters. These findings, in conjunction with previous biochemical studies, raise the possibility that, in mammalian brain, PKC plays a role in controlling the release of neurotransmitter and may be involved in the generation of LTP. © 1986 Nature Publishing Group.},

To determine whether granule cells can be induced to express mRNA of F1/GAP-43, transcript levels were studied after limbic seizures, which can induce sprouting of granule cell mossy fibers. Seizure-inducing electrolytic lesions were made in the dentate gyrus hilus with stainless-steel electrodes and mRNA levels were measured in contralateral hippocampus by quantitative in situ hybridization. Induction of F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression was observed in granule cells at 24 h, but not at 6 or 12 h, after the hilar lesion. When equivalent sized hilar lesions were made with platinum electrodes, which do not induce seizures, no hybridization was apparent over the granule cells. Hybridization over granule cells had declined by 48 h post-lesion, but even at 10 days it was still slightly higher than in control rats. F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression was also increased 2-fold in CA1 pyramidal cells with peak expression at 48 h post-lesion. These are the first data to our knowledge that demonstrate that F1/GAP-43 gene expression can be altered in neurons located within the adult brain. Induction of F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression in the granule cells may be important for the sprouting of mossy fibers and could be triggered by the elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in CA3 cells which precede the increased F1/GAP-3 gene expression in granule cells. © 1993.},

There is strong evidence that CB1 receptor on glutamatergic hippocampal neurons is beneficial to alleviate epileptiform seizures in mouse and man. Therefore, we hypothesized that experimentally increased CB1 gene dosage in principal neurons would have therapeutic effects in kainic acid (KA)-induced hippocampal pathogenesis. Here, we show that virus-mediated conditional over expression of CB1 receptor in pyramidal and mossy cells of the hippocampus is neuroprotective and moderates onvulsions in the acute KA seizure model in mice. We introduce a recombinant denoassociated virus (AAV) genome with a short stop element flanked by loxP sites, for highly efficient attenuation of ansgene xpression on the transcriptional level. The presence of Cre-recombinase is strictly necessary for expression of reporter proteins or CB1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic CB1 receptor immunoreactivity is targeted to glutamatergic neurons after stereotaxic delivery of AAV to the dorsal hippocampus of the driver mice NEX-cre. Increased CB1 receptor protein levels in hippocampal lysates of AAV-treated Cre-mice is paralleled by enhanced cannabinoid-induced G-protein activation. KA-induced seizure severity and mortality is reduced in CB1 receptor overexpressors compared with AAV-treated control animals. Neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA3 field is specifically absent from AAV-treated Cre-transgenics, but evident throughout cortical areas of both treatment groups.

   abstract = {Endocannabinoids are neuromodulators that act as retrograde synaptic messengers inhibiting the release of different neurotransmitters in cerebral areas such as hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. However, little is known about other roles of the endocannabinoid system in brain. In the present work we provide substantial evidence that the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) regulates neuronal differentiation both in culture and in vivo. Thus AEA, through the CB1 receptor, inhibited cortical neuron progenitor differentiation to mature neuronal phenotype. In addition, human neural stem cell differentiation and nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation were also inhibited by cannabinoid challenge. AEA decreased PC12 neuronal-like generation via CB1-mediated inhibition of sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which is responsible for nerve growth factor action. AEA thus inhibited TrkA-induced Rap1/B-Raf/ERK activation. Finally, immunohistochemical analyses by confocal microscopy revealed that adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus was significantly decreased by the AEA analogue methanandamide and increased by the CB1 antagonist SR141716. These data indicate that endocannabinoids inhibit neuronal progenitor cell differentiation through attenuation of the ERK pathway and suggest that they constitute a new physiological system involved in the regulation of neurogenesis.},

   abstract = {Anticonvulsant doses of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) markedly lower body temperature in mice at an ambient temperature of 22°C, but there is little such effect at 30°C. The anticonvulsant properties of Δ9-THC are as follows: The drug abolishes hind-limb extension in a maximal electroshock (MES) test, elevates both the MES (extensor) and 6-Hz-electroshock thresholds, exerts no effect on the 60-Hz-electroshock threshold, and enhances minimal seizures caused by pentylenetetrazol. All anticonvulsant properties studied, with the exception of the 60-Hz-electroshock threshold, were unaffected by the hypothermia resulting at 22°C. Additional experiments with Δ9-THC indicated that chronic treatment results in the development of tolerance, as determined by the MES test with rats. The four principal naturally occurring cannabinoids, Δ9-THC, Δ8-THC, cannabinol and cannabidiol, display anticonvulsant activity, as does the major, primary metabolite of Δ9-THC, 11-hydroxy-Δ9-THC. Of all agents investigated in mice, the synthetic cannabinoids, dimethylheptylpyran and its isomers, are the most potent anticonvulsants. The results of a study of the relative motor toxicity and anticonvulsant activity of the cannabinoids demonstrate that these properties are at least partially separable among the various agents. © 1974.},

It has been speculated that such growth may be mediated by cytoskeletal proteins. However, the interaction of GAP-43 with proteins of the presynaptic terminals is poorly characterized. Here, we analyze GAP-43 binding to cytoskeletal proteins by two different biochemical assays, by blot overlay and sedimentation. We find that immobilized brain spectrin (BS) is able to bind GAP-43. In contrast, little binding was observed to microtubule proteins and other elements of the cytoskeleton. Since GAP-43 is located presynaptically, it may bind to the presynaptic form of BS (SpIIΣ1). It is attractive to think that such an interaction would participate in the structural plasticity observed in growth cones and adult synapses.},

   abstract = {Summary: The effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on electrically evoked kindled seizures were studied in conscious, unrestrained rats with chronically implanted cortical and limbic electrodes, and the results were compared with those of Δ9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9‐THC), phenytoin (PHT), and ethosuximide (ESM). All drugs were anticonvulsant, but there were marked differences in their effects on afterdischarge (AD) threshold, duration, and amplitude. CBD, like PHT and Δ9‐THC, elevated the AD threshold; in contrast, ESM decreased the threshold but suppressed AD spread. CBD, however, also resembled ESM inasmuch as both drugs decreased AD duration and amplitude. Electrophysiologically, the antiseizure effects of CBD were a combination of those of PHT and ESM. The combination of effects may account for the observation that CBD was the most efficacious of the drugs tested against limbic ADs and convulsions. Other properties of CBD were also noted: For example, compared with Δ9‐THC, it is a much more selective anticonvulsant vis‐à‐vis motor toxicity. CBD also lacks the CNS excitatory effects produced by Δ9‐THC, PHT, and ESM. These characteristics, combined with its apparently unique set of electrophysiological properties, support the suggestion that CBD has therapeutic potential as an antiepileptic. Les effets du cannabidiol (CBD) sur les crises Ďembrasement provoquées par stimulation électrique ont éstéétudiés chez des rats conscients, non mainte‐nus, avec électrodes corticales et limbiques implantées. Les résultats ont été compareés à ceux obtenus avec le Δ9‐teatrahydrocannabinol (Δ9‐THC), la phénytoi'ne (PHT), et Ľéthosuccimide (ESM). Toutes ces drogues sont anticonvulsivantes, mais leurs effets se sont montrés très différents sur le seuil, la durée et Ľ amplitude des post‐décharges (PD). Le CBD élève le seuil des PD comme le PHT et le Δ9‐THC. Au contraire, ĽESM décroit le seuil mais supprime la propagation des PD. Toutefois, le CBD, comme ĽESM, diminue Ľ amplitude et la durée des PD. Ďun point de vue électrophysiologique, le CBD présente done un effet antiépileptique comparable à une combinaison Ďeffets du PHT et de ĽESM. Cette combinaison Ďeffets peut expliquer pourquoi le CBD est le plus efficace des produits testés contre les PD et les crises limbiques. Ďautres propriétés du CBD ont également été observées: par exemple, par comparaison avec le Δ9‐THC, il s'agit Ďun produit ayant des propnétés anticonvulsivantes beaucoup plus sélectives vis‐à‐vis des phénomenes moteurs. Le CBD n'entraine pas non plus les effets excitateurs du système nerveux central que produisent le Δ9‐THC, la PHT, ou ĽESM. Ces caractéristiques, ainsi que ses propriétés électrophysiologiques apparemment uniques, permettent de suggérer que le CBD a un potentiel thérapeutique en tant qu'antiépileptique. Los efectos del cannabidiol (CBD) sobre los ataques condicionados evocados electricamente han sido es‐tudiados en ratas conscientes y libres con electrodos cnonicos implantados en la corteza y en el sistema límbico. Los resultados han sido comparados con los del Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9‐THC), de la fenitoina (PHT) y de la etosuximida (ESM). Todas las drogas eran anticonvulsivas pero existían claras diferencias en sus efectos sobre el umbral, la duración y la amplitud de la post‐descarga (AD). El CBD, al igual que la PHT y el Δ9‐THC, elevaron el umbral de la AD; por el contrario la ESM redujo el umbral pero suprimio la propagación de la AD. Sin embargo el CBD fue algo semejante a la ESM ya que ambas drogas redujeron la duración y amplitud de la AD. Electro‐fisiológicamente, los efectos anti‐ataque del CBD fueron una combinación de los de la PHT y los de la ESM. Esta combinación de efectos puede explicar la observación de que el CBD fue, de las drogas analizadas, la más eficaz contra la AD límbica y los ataques limbicos. Otras propiedades del CBD han sido también observadas: por ejemplo, compareándolo con el Δ9‐THC, es mejor anticonvulsive en relación con su toxicidad motora. El CBD tampoco presenta los efectos excitadores producidos por el Δ9‐THC, la PHT y la ESM. Estas characterísticas, combinadas con sus específicas propiedades electrofisiologicas, apoyan la sugerencia de que el CBD tiene potencial terapeútico como antiepiléptico. Die Wirkung des Cannabidiols (CBD) auf elek‐trisch evozierte Kindling‐Anfälle wurde bei “be‐wußtseinsklaren,” frei sich bewegenden Ratten mit chronisch implantierten kortikalen und limbischen Elektroden untersucht. Die Ergebnisse wurden mit denen verglichen, die durch Delta‐9‐Tet‐rahydrocannabiol (Delta‐9‐THC), Phenytoin (PHT), und Ethosuximid (ESM) erzielt wurden. Alle Drogen wirkten antikonvulsiv, aber es bestanden deutliche Unterschiede in ihren Wirkungen auf Schwelle, Dauer und Amplitude, der Nachentladung (AD). CBD, ebenso wie PHT und Delta‐9‐THC, erhohten den AD‐Schwellenwert. Im Gegensatz hierzu verminderte ESM den Schwellenwert aber unter‐driickte die Ausbreitung. CBD hingegen ähnelte dem ESM insofern, als beide Drogen die AD‐Dauer und Amplitude verminderten. Die antikonvulsiven Wirkungen des CBD bestanden physiologisch in einer Kombination der Wirkungen von PHT und ESM. Die Wirkungskombination mag verantwortlich sein fur die Beobachtung, daß CBD die Substanz war unter den getesteten, die am wirkungsvollsten gegen limbische AD und limbische Anfälle war. Andere Eígenschaften des CBD wurden festgestellt: Z.B. ist es verglichen mit Delta‐9‐THC viel selektiver antikonvulsiv wirksam im Verhältnis zu seiner toxischen Wirkung auf die Motorik. Dem CBD fehlt die excitatorische Wirkung auf das ZNS, die durch Delta‐9‐THC, PHT, und ESM erzielt wird. Diese Charaktaristika zusammen mit offenbar einzigartigen elektrophysiologischen Eigenschaften unterstiltzen die Vermutung, daB CBD therapeutische Möglichkeiten als Antiepileptikum besitzt.

   abstract = {G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) are membrane-attached proteins composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma. They transduce signals from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to target effector proteins. The agonistactivated receptor induces a conformational change in the G-protein trimer so that the alpha-subunit binds GTP in exchange for GDP and alpha-GTP, and betagamma-subunits separate to interact with the target effector. Effector-interaction is terminated by the alpha-subunit GTPase activity, whereby bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. This is accelerated in situ by RGS proteins, acting as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Galpha-GDP and Gbetagamma then reassociate to form the Galphabetagamma trimer. G-proteins primarily involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release are G(o), G(q) and G(s). G(o) mediates the widespread presynaptic auto-inhibitory effect of many neurotransmitters (e.g., via M2/M4 muscarinic receptors, alpha(2) adrenoreceptors, micro/delta opioid receptors, GABAB receptors). The G(o) betagamma-subunit acts in two ways: first, and most ubiquitously, by direct binding to CaV2 Ca(2+) channels, resulting in a reduced sensitivity to membrane depolarization and reduced Ca(2+) influx during the terminal action potential; and second, through a direct inhibitory effect on the transmitter release machinery, by binding to proteins of the SNARE complex. G(s) and G(q) are mainly responsible for receptor-mediated facilitatory effects, through activation of target enzymes (adenylate cyclase, AC and phospholipase-C, PLC respectively) by the GTP-bound alpha-subunits.},

   abstract = {To ascertain the subcellular localization of the growth-associated protein GAP-43 in growth cones, we isolated growth cones from the forebrains of neonatal rats. Anti-GAP-43 immunoreactivity in these isolated growth cones (IGCs) resembled that seen in cultured growth cones in 2 respects: First, in substrate-attached IGCs, as in cultured growth cones, immunoreactivity was intracellular, punctate, and extended throughout the IGCs and their processes. Second, when IGCs were dislodged from this substrate, patches of membrane that were highly immunoreactive for GAP-43 were left behind. Extracting IGCs in nonionic detergents revealed that almost all the particulate GAP-43 colocalized with a membrane skeleton fraction: It was not present in the cytoskeleton. The association of GAP-43 with the membrane skeleton was not due to nonspecific aggregation, nor was it calcium dependent. Examination of this fraction under the electron microscope showed it to consist of membrane fragments associated with amorphous material that could be visualized with tannic acid. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that anti-GAP-43 immunoreactivity was localized to this amorphous material. Fodrin, talin, and a a-actinin immunoreactivity could be detected in the membrane skeleton fraction, and actin and tubulin were also identifiable from SDS gels. The association of GAP-43 with the membrane skeleton, which by analogy with other cell types is involved in the dynamic regulation of cell shape, implies that GAP-43 in growth cones may be involved in this function.},

   abstract = {The modulation of presynaptic calcium channel activity by second messengers provides a fine tuning mechanism for neurotransmitter release. In neurons, the activation of certain G protein-coupled receptors reduces N- type channel activity by ~60%. In contrast, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) results in an approximately 50% increase in N-type channel activity, and subsequent G protein inhibition is antagonized. Here, we describe the molecular determinants that control the dual effects of PKC-dependent phosphorylation. The double substitution of two adjacent PKC consensus sites in the calcium channel domain I-II linker (Thr422, Ser425) to alanines abolished both PKC-dependent up-regulation and the PKC-G protein cross-talk. The single substitution of Ser425 to glutamic acid abolished PKC up- regulation but had no effect on G protein modulation. Replacement of Thr422 with glutamic acid eliminated PKC-dependent up-regulation and mimicked the effects of PKC phosphorylation on G protein inhibition. Our data suggest that Thr422 mediates the antagonistic effect of PKC on G protein modulation, while phosphorylation of either Thr422 or Ser425 are sufficient to increase N-type channel activity. Thus, Thr422 serves as a molecular switch by which PKC is able to simultaneously trigger the upregulation of channel activity and antagonize G protein inhibition.},

Protein kinase C (PKC) activity and phosphorylation of F1/growth associated protein (GAP)-43, a PKC substrate, have been proposed to play key roles in the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the synapses of Schaffer collateral/commissural on pyramidal neurons in CA1 (Akers et al., 1986). We have studied in the involvement of PKC and PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation of F1/GAP-3 in in vitro LTP observed at the synapses of mossy fiber (MF) on CA3 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus by post hoc in vitro phosphorylation. 2. After LTP was induced in CA3 in either the presence or absence of D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5), an NMDA receptor antagonist, the CA3 region was dissected for in vitro phosphorylation assay. In vivo phosphorylation of F1/GAP-43 was increased in membranes at 1 and 5 min after tetanic stimulation (TS) but not at 60 min after TS. 3. The degree of phosphorylation of F1/GAP-43 in the cytosol was inversely related to that in membranes at each time point after LTP. 4. The similar biochemical changes obtained from either control slices or AP5-treated slices indicate that LTP and the underlying biochemical changes are independent of the NMDA receptor. Immunoreactivity of the phophorylated F1/GAP-43 in LTP slices was not significantly different from control, indicating that results from western blotting and post hoc in vitro phosphorylation are consistent. 5. Post hoc in vitro phosphorylation of F1/GAP-43 was PKC-mediated since phosphorylation of F1/GAP-43 was altered by the PKC activation cofactors, Ca2+, phosphatidylserine and phorbol ester. 6. Calmodulin (CAM) at >5 μM inhibited phosphorylation, consistent with the presence of CaM-binding activity at the site on F1/GAP-43 acted upon by PKC. 7. We conclude that phosphorylation of F1/GAP-43 is associated with the induction but not the maintenance phase of MF-CA3 LTP.},

   abstract = {LONG-term potentiation (LTP) is a widely studied model of the synaptic basis of information storage in the mammalian brain. The induction of LTP is triggered by the postsynaptic entry of calcium through the channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, whereas its maintenance is mediated, at least in part, by presynaptic mechanisms. To explain how postsynaptic events can lead to an increase in transmitter release, we have postulated the existence of a retrograde messenger to carry information from the postsynaptic side of the synapse to recently active presynaptic terminals. Candidates for a retrograde messenger include arachidonic acid or one of its lipoxygenase metabolites. Here we report that weak activation of the perforant path, when given in the presence of arachidonic acid, leads to a slow-onset persistent increase in synaptic efficacy both in vivo and in vitro. The activity-dependent potentiation thus produced is accompanied by an increase in the release of glutamate, and is non-additive with tetanus-induced LTP. These observations indicate a role for arachidonic acid as a retrograde messenger in the later, but not the initial, stages of LTP. © 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here we have examined changes in the in situ phosphorylation level of two major PKC substrates, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and growth-associated protein (GAP)-43/B-50, after pharmacological stimulation or induction of LTP or LTD in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. We find that direct PKC activation with phorbol esters, K+-induced depolarization, and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors increase the in situ phosphorylation of both MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50. The induction of LTP increased the in situ phosphorylation of both MARCKS and GAP-43/B-50 at 10 min following high-frequency stimulation, but only GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation remained elevated 60 min after LTP induction. Furthermore, blockade of LTP induction with the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5- phosphonopentanoic acid prevented elevations in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation but did not prevent the elevation in MARCKS phosphorylation 10 min following LTP induction. The induction of LTD resulted in a reduction in GAP-43/B-50 phosphorylation but did not affect MARCKS phosphorylation. Together these findings show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity elicits PKC- mediated phosphorylation of substrate proteins in a highly selective and coordinated manner and demonstrate the compartmentalization of PKC-substrate interactions.},

GAP43, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), and CAP23 (GMC) are locally abundant, plasmalemma-associated PKC substrates that affect actin cytoskeleton. Their expression correlates with morphogenic processes and cell motility, but their role in cortex regulation has been difficult to define mechanistically. We now show that the three proteins accumulate at rafts, where they codistribute with PI(4,5)P2, and promote its retention and clustering. Binding and modulation of PI(4,5)P2 depended on the basic effector domain (ED) of these proteins, and constructs lacking the ED functioned as dominant inhibitors of plasmalemmal PI(4,5)P2 modulation. In the neuronlike cell line, PC12, NGF- and substrate-induced peripheral actin structures, and neurite outgrowth were greatly augmented by any of the three proteins, and suppressed by ΔED mutants. Agents that globally mask PI(4,5)P2 mimicked the effects of GMC on peripheral actin recruitment and cell spreading, but interfered with polarization and process formation. Dominant negative GAP43(ΔED) also interfered with peripheral nerve regeneration, stimulus-induced nerve sprouting and control of anatomical plasticity at the neuromuscular junction of transgenic mice. These results suggest that GMC are functionally and mechanistically related PI(4,5)P2 modulating proteins, upstream of actin and cell cortex dynamics regulation.},

Likewise, recreational cannabis use during pregnancy affects brain structure and function of the progeny. However, the precise neurobiological substrates underlying the consequences of prenatal THC exposure remain unknown. As CB1 signaling is known to modulate long-range corticofugal connectivity, we analyzed the impact of THC exposure on cortical projection neuron development. THC administration to pregnant mice in a restricted time window interfered with subcerebral projection neuron generation, thereby altering corticospinal connectivity, and produced long-lasting alterations in the fine motor performance of the adult offspring. Consequences of THC exposure were reminiscent of those elicited by CB1 receptor genetic ablation, and CB1-null mice were resistant to THC-induced alterations. The identity of embryonic THC neuronal targets was determined by a Cre-mediated, lineage-specific, CB1 expression-rescue strategy in a CB1-null background. Early and selective CB1 reexpression in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons but not forebrain GABAergic neurons rescued the deficits in corticospinal motor neuron development of CB1-null mice and restored susceptibility to THC-induced motor alterations. In addition, THC administration induced an increase in seizure susceptibility that was mediated by its interference with CB1-dependent regulation of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron development. These findings demonstrate that prenatal exposure to THC has long-lasting deleterious consequences in the adult offspring solely mediated by its ability to disrupt the neurodevelopmental role of CB1 signaling.},

   abstract = {Major brain functions depend on neuronal processes that favor the plasticity of neuronal circuits while at the same time maintaining their stability. The mechanisms that regulate brain plasticity are complex and engage multiple cascades of molecular components that modulate synaptic efficacy. Protein kinases (PKs) and phosphatases (PPs) are among the most important of these components that act as positive and negative regulators of neuronal signaling and plasticity, respectively. In these cascades, the PP protein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin (CaN) is of particular interest because it is the only Ca2+-activated PP in the brain and a major regulator of key proteins essential for synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This review describes the primary properties of CaN and illustrates its functions and modes of action by focusing on several representative targets, in particular glutamate receptors, striatal enriched protein phosphatase (STEP), and neuromodulin (GAP43), and their functional significance for synaptic plasticity and memory. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

   abstract = {Growth cones generate spontaneous transient elevations of intracellular Ca2+ that regulate the rate of neurite outgrowth. Here we report that these Ca2+ waves inhibit neurite extension via the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CN) in Xenopus spinal neurons. Pharmacological blockers of CN (cyclosporin A and deltamethrin) and peptide inhibitors of CN [the Xenopus CN (xCN) autoinhibitory domain and African swine fever virus protein A238L] block the Ca2+-dependent reduction of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Time-lapse microscopy of growing neurites demonstrates directly that the reduction in the rate of outgrowth by Ca2+ transients is blocked by cyclosporin A. In contrast, expression of a constitutively active form of xCN in the absence of waves results in shorter neurite lengths similar to those seen in the presence of waves. The developmental expression pattern of xCN transcripts in vivo coincides temporally with axonal pathfinding by spinal neurons, supporting a role of CN in regulating Ca2+-dependent neurite extension in the spinal cord. Ca2+ wave frequency and Ca2+-dependent expression of GABA are not affected by inhibition or activation of CN. However, phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal element GAP-43, which promotes actin polymerization, is reduced by Ca2+ waves and enhanced by suppression of CN activity. CN ultimately acts on the growth cone actin cytoskeleton, because disrupting actin microfilaments with cytochalasin D or stabilizing them with jasplakinolide negates the effects of suppressing or activating CN. Destabilization or stabilization of microtubules with colcemide or taxol results in Ca2+-independent inhibition of neurite outgrowth. The results identify components of the cascade by which Ca2+ waves act to regulate neurite extension.},

   abstract = {Neuronal growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) has crucial roles in the nervous system, and during development, regeneration after injury, and learning and memory. GAP43 is expressed in mouse skeletal muscle fibers and satellite cells, with suggested its involvement in intracellular Ca2+ handling. However, the physiological role of GAP43 in muscle remains unknown. Using a GAP43-knockout (GAP43-/-) mouse, we have defined the role of GAP43 in skeletal muscle. GAP43-/- mice showed low survival beyond weaning, reduced adult body weight, decreased muscle strength, and changed myofiber ultrastructure, with no significant differences in the expression of markers of satellite cell and myotube progression through the myogenic program. Thus, GAP43 expression is involved in timing of muscle maturation in-vivo. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements in-vitro in myotubes revealed GAP43 involvement in Ca2+ handling. In the absence of GAP43 expression, the spontaneous Ca2+ variations had greater amplitudes and higher frequency. In GAP43-/- myotubes, also the intracellular Ca2+ variations induced by the activation of dihydropyridine and ryanodine Ca2++ channels, resulted modified. These evidences suggested dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. The emerging hypothesis indicates that GAP43 interacts with calmodulin to indirectly modulate the activities of dihydropyridine and ryanodine Ca2+ channels. This thus influences intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and its related intracellular patterns, from functional excitation-contraction coupling, to cell metabolism, and gene expression.},

   abstract = {To study the role of kinase C phosphorlation in the distribution and function of GAP-43 we have generated a panel of mAbs that distinguish between GAP-43 that has been phosphorylated by kinase C and forms that have not. One class of antibodies, typified by 2G12/C7, reacts with only the phosphorylated form of GAP-43; it recognizes the peptide IQAS(PO4)FR equivalent to residues 38-43 that includes the single kinase C phosphorylation site at serine. Another, exemplified by 10E8/E7, reacts with both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. We have used the antibodies to study the distribution of kinase C-phosphorylated GAP-43 during axonogenesis and in the adult nervous system. Two major findings emerge. First, there is a lag between the initiation of axon outgrowth and the phosphorylation of GAP-43 by kinase C. The extent of this lag period varies between the different structures studied. In some cases, e.g., the trigeminal , our result suggest that kinase C phosphorylation may be correlated with proximity of the growing axon to its target. Second, kinase C-phosphorylated GAP-43 is always spatially restricted to the distal axon. It is never seen either proximally or in cell bodies, even those with high levels of GAP-43 protein. This result also implies that GAP-43 is axonally transported in the non-kinase C phosphorylated form. Thus, kinase C phosphorylation of GAP-43 is not required for axon outgrowth or growth cone function per se and may be more related to interactions of the growth cone with its environment.},

   abstract = {Neuromodulin (P-57, GAP-43, B-50, F-1) is a neurospecific calmodulin-binding protein believed to play a role in regulation of neurite outgrowth and neuroplasticity. Neuromodulin is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and this phosphorylation prevents calmodulin from binding to neuromodulin (Alexander, K. A., Cimler, B. M., Meier, K. E. and Storm, D. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6108-6113). The only other protein kinase known to phosphorylate neuromodulin is casein kinase II (Pisano, M. R., Hegazy, M. G., Reimann, E. M. and Dokas, L. A. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 155, 1207-1212). Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that casein kinase II modified serine and threonine residues in both native bovine and recombinant mouse neuromodulin. Two serines located in the C-terminal end of neuromodulin, Ser-192 and Ser-193, were identified as the major casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Thr-88, Thr-89, or Thr-95 were identified as minor casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II did not affect the ability of neuromodulin to bind to calmodulin-Sepharose. However, calmodulin did inhibit the phosphorylation of neuromodulin by casein kinase II with a K(i) of 1-2 μM. Calmodulin inhibition of casein kinase II phosphorylation was due to calmodulin binding to neuromodulin rather than to the protein kinase. These data suggest that the minimal secondary and tertiary structure exhibited by neuromodulin may be sufficient to juxtapose its calmodulin-binding domain, located at the N-terminal end, with the neuromodulin casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal end of the protein. We propose that calmodulin regulates casein kinase II phosphorylation of neuromodulin by binding to neuromodulin and sterically hindering the interaction of casein kinase II with its phosphorylation sites on neuromodulin.},

Two pairs of peptides with a mass difference of 80 Da were observed. From the tandem mass spectrometry, two novel phosphorylation sites (Thr-87 and Ser-152) were identified. The novel phosphorylation sites contain proline immediately after the phosphorylated serines. No phosphorylated peptide was detected corresponding to the protein kinase C or casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. A peptide corresponding to the acetylated N- terminal peptide was also identified. The mass of the peptide suggests that the 2 cysteinyl residues are not palmitoylated but form a disulfide bridge.},

In adult brain, the B-50 levels are decreased. B-50 is primarily found in axons and presynaptic terminals. It is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and this process has been implicated in the modulation of membrane signal transduction. During the outgrowth of the pyramidal tract, high levels of B-50 have been reported, whereas a low amount of B-50 persists into the adult stage. By immunoelectron microscopy, using immunogold labeling on cryosections and pre-embedding peroxidase labeling, we examined the distribution of B-50 in the pyramidal tract at the third cervical segment in developing 2-d-old and adult 90-d-old rats. B-50 immunoreactivity was found in axons and growth cones of the outgrowing tract. In the adult pyramidal tract, both unmyelinated and myelinated axons contained B-50 immunoreactivity. The immunogold label was predominantly located at the plasma membrane. Since the peroxidase reaction product was observed exclusively intracellularly, we conclude that the B-50 immunoreactivity is predominantly located at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane of axons and growth cones. The high immunoreactivity in growth cones and axons of the outgrowing pyramidal tract further supports the hypothesis that B-50 plays a role in neurite outgrowth. The presence of B-50 in adult pyramidal tract cannot merely be attributed to transport to the synapse. Therefore, it is suggested that B-50 plays, in addition, a local, growth-associated role in the adult tract.},

The mechanisms by which NRTIs contribute to the development of neuropathic pain are not known. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that HuD, an RNA binding protein known to be an essential promoter of neuronal differentiation and survival, might be involved in the response to NRTI-induced neuropathy. Antiretroviral neuropathy was induced by a single intraperitoneal administration of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) in mice. HuD was physiologically expressed in the cytoplasm of the soma and in axons of neurons within DRG and spinal cord and was considerably overexpressed following ddC treatment. ddC up-regulated spinal GAP43 protein, a marker of neuroregeneration, and this increase was counteracted by HuD silencing. GAP43 and HuD colocalize in DRG and spinal dorsal horn (SDH) axons and administration of an anti-GAP43 antibody aggravated the ddC-induced axonal damage. The administration of a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor or the PKCγ silencing prevented both HuD and GAP43 increased expression. Conversely, treatment with the PKC activator PDBu potentiated HuD and GAP43 overexpression, demonstrating the presence of a spinal PKC-dependent HuD-GAP43 pathway activated by ddC. These results indicated that HuD recruitment and GAP43 protein increase are mechanistically linked events involved in the response to antiretroviral-induced neurodegenerative processes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We utilized unmodified Sepharose-4B as a specific adsorbent and 0.2 M lactose solution as an elution buffer. Fusion proteins of LSL-tag and porcine circovirus capsid protein, designated LSL-Cap was recovered with purity of 90 ± 4%, and yield of 87 ± 3% from crude extract of recombinant Escherichia coli. To enable the remove of LSL-tag, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence was placed downstream of LSL-tag in the expression vector, and LSL-tagged TEV protease, designated LSL-TEV, was also expressed in E. coli., and was recovered with purity of 82 ± 5%, and yield of 85 ± 2% from crude extract of recombinant E. coli. After digestion of LSL-tagged recombinant proteins with LSL-TEV, the LSL tag and LSL-TEV can be easily removed by passing the digested products through the Sepharose column. It is of worthy noting that the Sepharose can be reused after washing with PBS. The LSL affinity purification method enables rapid and inexpensive purification of LSL-tagged fusion proteins and scale-up production of native proteins.},

   abstract = {The hippocampal formation is part of an anatomical system critically involved in learning and memory. Increasing evidence suggests that dopamine plays an important role in learning and memory as well as in several forms of synaptic plasticity. However, the precise identification of neuronal populations expressing D1 or D2 dopamine receptors within the hippocampus is still lacking. To clarify this issue, we used BAC transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the promoter of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. In Drd1a-EGFP mice, sparse GFP-expressing neurons were detected among glutamatergic projecting neurons of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and GABAergic interneurons located in the hilus. A dense immunofluorescence was observed in the outer and medial part of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus as well as in the inner part of the molecular layer of CA1 corresponding to the terminals of pyramidal neurons of the entorhinal cortex defining the perforant and the temporo-ammonic pathway respectively. Finally, scattered D1 receptor-expressing neurons were also identified as GABAergic interneurons in the CA3/CA1 fields of the hippocampus. In Drd2-EGFP transgenic mice, GFP was exclusively detected in the glutamatergic mossy cells located in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. This pattern was confirmed in Drd2-Cre mice crossed with NLS-LacZ-TaumGFP:LoxP and RCE:LoxP reporter lines. Our results demonstrate that D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons are strictly segregated in the mouse hippocampus. By clarifying the identity of D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the hippocampus, this study establishes a basis for future investigations aiming at elucidating their roles in the hippocampal network. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We have taken advantage of the fact that Purkinje cells do not express GAP-43 or L1 in adult mammals or regenerate axons into peripheral nerve grafts to test the importance of these molecules for axonal regeneration in vivo. Transgenic mice were generated in which Purkinje cells constitutively express L1 or both L1 and GAP-43 under the Purkinje cell-specific L7 promoter, and regeneration of Purkinje cell axons into peripheral nerve grafts implanted into the cerebellum was examined. Purkinje cells expressing GAP-43 or L1 showed minor enhancement of axonal sprouting. Purkinje cells expressing both GAP-43 and L1 showed more extensive axonal sprouting and axonal growth into the proximal portion of the graft. When a predegenerated nerve graft was implanted into double-transgenic mice, penetration of the graft by Purkinje cell axonal sprouts was strongly enhanced, and some axons grew along the entire intracerebral length of the graft (2.5-3.0 mm) and persisted for several months. The results demonstrate that GAP-43 and L1 coexpressed in Purkinje cells can act synergistically to switch these regeneration-incompetent CNS neurons into a regeneration-competent phenotype and show that coexpression of these molecules is a key regulator of the regenerative ability of intrinsic CNS neurons in vivo. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Thalamocortical afferents to -/- cortex form irregular patches in layer IV within a poorly defined cortical field, which varies between hemispheres, rather than the stereotypic, whisker-specific, segregated map seen in normal animals. Furthermore, many thalamocortical afferents project abnormally to widely separated cortical targets.

   abstract = {Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that phorbol diesters enhance the release of various neurotransmitters. It is generally accepted that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is the mechanism by which phorbol diesters act on neurotransmitter release. The action of PKC in neurotransmitter release is very likely mediated by phosphorylation of substrate proteins localized in the presynaptic nerve terminal. An important presynaptic substrate of PKC is B‐50. To investigate whether B‐50 mediates the actions of PKC in neurotransmitter release, we have studied B‐50 phosphorylation in intact rat hippocampal slices under conditions that stimulate or inhibit PKC and neurotransmitter release. The slices were labelled with [32P]orthophosphate. After treatment, the slices were homogenized, B‐50 was immunoprecipitated from the slice homogenate, and the incorporation of 32P into B‐50 was determined. Chemical depolarization (30 μM K+) and the presence of phorbol diesters, conditions that stimulate neurotransmitter release, separately and in combination, also enhance B‐50 phosphorylation. Polymyxin B, an inhibitor of PKC and neurotransmitter release, decreases concentration dependently the depolarization‐induced stimulation of B‐50 phosphorylation. The effects of depolarization are not detectable at low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. It is concluded that in rat hippocampal slices B‐50 may mediate the action of PKC in neurotransmitter release. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

   abstract = {Neuromodulin (P-57, GAP-43, B-50, F-1) is a neurospecific calmodulin binding protein that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C has been shown to abolish the affinity of neuromodulin for calmodulin [Alexander, K. A., Cimler, B. M., Meier, K. E., & Storm, D. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6108-6113], and we have proposed that the concentration of free CaM in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neuromodulin. The purpose of this study was to identify the protein kinase C phosphorylation site(s) in neuromodulin using recombinant neuromodulin as a substrate. Toward this end, it was demonstrated that recombinant neuromodulin purified from Escherichia coli and bovine neuromodulin were phosphorylated with similar Km values and stoichiometries and that protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of both proteins abolished binding to calmodulin- Sepharose. Recombinant neuromodulin was phosphorylated by using protein kinase C and [γ-32P]ATP and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Only one 32P-labeled tryptic peptide was generated from phosphorylateid neuromodulin. The sequence of this peptide was IQASFR. The serine in this peptide corresponds to position 41 of the entire protein, which is adjacent to or contained within the calmodulin binding domain of neuromodulin. A synthetic peptide, QASFRGHITRKKLKGEK, corresponding to the calmodulin binding domain with a few flanking residues, including serine-41, was also phosphorylated by protein kinase C. We conclude that serine-41 is the protein kinase C phosphorylation site of neuromodulin and that phosphorylation of this amino acid residue blocks binding of calmodulin to neuromodulin. The proximity of serine-41 to the calmodulin binding domain in neuromodulin very likely explains the effect of phosphorylation on the affinity of neuromodulin for calmodulin. © 1990, American Chemical Society.

   abstract = {The growth-associated protein-43/B-50 (B-50/GAP-43) is conveyed from the neuronal soma into the axon by fast axonal transport and moved to the nerve terminal. To visualize and determine the type of vesicles by which B-50/GAP-43 is anterogradely transported in the regenerating rat sciatic nerve, we have investigated Lowicryl HM20 embedded nerve pieces dissected from the proximal side of a collection ligature. Ultrastructurally, numerous vesicular profiles of various sizes, tubules and mitochondria were seen to accumulate proximal to the collection ligature. Both, in unmyelinated and myelinated axons, B-50/GAP-43 immunoreactivity was associated with vesicular profiles which had a diameter of 50 nm. A fraction of the B-50/GAP-43 label co-localized with the small vesicle marker synaptophysin. Co-localization of B-50/GAP-43 was not detected with the large dense-core vesicle marker calcitonin gene-related peptide. These results indicate that, in rat sciatic nerve axons, B-50/GAP-43 is anterogradely transported in small 50 nm vesicles of the constitutive pathway. These transport vesicles were distinguished in two types. We suggest that one type carrying, both, B-50 GAP-43 and synaptophysin has as destination the nerve terminal, whereas the second type, which only contains B-50/GAP-43 and no synaptophysin, may be primarily targeted to the axolemma for local membrane fusion.},

   abstract = {We compared excitatory synaptic transmission between hippocampal pyramidal cells in dissociated hippocampal cell cultures and in area CA3 of hippocampal slice cultures derived from wild-type mice and mice with a genetic deletion of the presynaptic growth associated protein GAP-43. The basal frequency and amplitude of action potential-dependent and -independent spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were similar in both groups. The probability that any two CA3 pyramidal cells in wild-type or GAP-43 knockout (-/-) slice cultures were synaptically connected was assessed with paired recordings and was not different. Furthermore, unitary synaptic responses were similar in the two genotypes. Bath application of phorbol 12,13-diacetate (0.6-3 μM) elicited a comparable increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents in wild-type and GAP-43 (-/-) cultures. This effect was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (1.2 μM). Finally, 3 μM phorbol 12,13-diacetate potentiated the amplitude of unitary synaptic currents to a comparable extent in wild-type and GAP-43 (-/-) slice cultures. We conclude that GAP-43 is not required for normal excitatory synaptic transmission or the potentiation of presynaptic glutamate release mediated by activation of protein kinase C in the hippocampus.},

   abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of plasma membrane receptors, thus representing the more investigated drug targets in the design of new therapeutic strategies. The existence of receptor-receptor interactions has revolutionized the field, since GPCR oligomerization might confer new intervention opportunities in pharmacotherapy. However, demonstrating the existence of such receptor-receptor interactions in native tissue has been a bottleneck in GPCR pharmacology. Here, we discuss an experimental approach, the proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA), which provides enough sensitivity to evaluate a receptor's close proximity within a named GPCR oligomer. Indeed, we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for PLISA experiments visualizing receptor-receptor interactions in brain slices. Additionally, we provide instructions for slide observation, data acquisition and quantification. Finally, we also discuss these critical aspects determining the success of the technique, namely the fixation process and the validation of the primary antibodies used. Overall, the P-LISA is a powerful and straightforward technique to visualize receptor-receptor interactions when performed under optimal conditions.},

   abstract = {1. Previous reports have shown that group 111 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) serve as autoreceptors at the lateral perforant path, but to date there has been no rigorous determination of the roles of other mGluRs as autoreceptors at this synapse. Furthermore, it is not known which of the the mGluR subtypes serve as autoreceptors at the medial perforant path synapse. With the use of whole cell patch-clamp and field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recording techniques, we examined the groups of mGluRs that act as autoreceptors at lateral and medial perforant path synapses in adult rat hippocampal slices. 2. Consistent with previous reports, the group III mGluR agonist (D,L) 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid reduced fEPSPs and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the dentate gyrus. However, the group-II-selective agonist (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2,3- dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) also reduced fEPSPs and EPSCs, suggesting that multiple mGluR subtypes may serve as autoreceptors at perforant path synapses. 3. Selective activation of either medial or lateral perforant pathways revealed that micromolar concentrations of (L)-2-amino-4- phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) reduce fEPSPs in lateral but not medial perforant path, suggesting group III involvement at the lateral perforant pathway. Conversely, DCG-IV and 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate, another group-II-selective mGluR agonist, potently reduced fEPSPs at the medial but not lateral perforant path, suggesting that a group II mGluR may act as an autoreceptor at the medial perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse. 4. Antagonist studies with group-selective antagonists such as (2S,3S,4S)-2- methyl-2-(carboxycyclpropyl)glycine (MCCG; group II) and α-methyl-L-AP4 (MAP4; group III) suggest differential involvement of each group at these synapses. The effect of L-AP4 at the lateral perforant path synapse was blocked by MAP-4, but not MCCG. In contrast, the effect of DCG-IV was blocked by application of MCCG, but not MAP4. 5. Previous studies suggest that the effect of L-AP4 at the lateral perforant path synapse is mediated by a presynaptic mechanism. In the present studies, we found that concentrations of DCG-IV that reduce transmission at the medial perforant path synapse reduce paired-pulse depression and do not reduce kainate-evoked currents recorded from dentate granule cells. This is consistent with the hypothesis that DCG-IV also acts by a presynaptic mechanism.},
